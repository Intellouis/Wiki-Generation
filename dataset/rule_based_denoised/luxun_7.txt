Lu Xun’s Fictions
Kong Yiji describes an intellect inflicted by the imperial examination system. The story is written with a laconic and simple structure and in concise language. It castigates the evil of the examination system in trampling and destroying people’s lives. Medicine is another famous short story exposing the life destroying feudal system. It depicts not only the uneducated common people who are devoured by feudal superstition, but also a young revolutionary who is killed by the sword of feudal autocracy. One incident in the story, where Hua Laoshuan buys a bun soaked in martyr’s blood in hope of curing his son’s disease, has become a well-known literary quotation referring to the need for enlightenment.
Lu Xun cares about peasants’ lives very much. Many stories in Call to Arms and Wandering truthfully depict peasants’ tragic lives after the 1911 Revolution. Stormreflects the never-changing rural life after Zhang Xun’s restoration by describing a small disturbance in the boatman Qijin’s family in Luxian County.
By learning from the concise, flexible and varied structure of foreign fiction, Lu Xun broke away from the exclusive form of traditional Chinese fiction, which had been written only in chapters, to create a new form for modern Chinese fiction. Therefore, Lu Xun is looked upon as the father of the modem Chinese fiction.
