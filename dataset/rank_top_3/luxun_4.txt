Life
Early life
His father's chronic illness and eventual death when Lu Xun was sixteen, apparently from alcoholism, later inspired him to study medicine. His father’s death left the family impoverished.
Education
Lu Xun left for Japan in 1902, on a Qing government scholarship. He first attended the Kobun Gakuin (Hongwen xueyuan, 弘文學院), a preparatory language school for Chinese students attending Japanese universities. His earliest essays, written in Classical Chinese, date from here. Lu also practiced some jujutsu.
Lu Xun returned home briefly in 1903, and at the age of twenty-two, entered into a marriage with a girl from the local gentry, Zhu An (朱安). Zhu, illiterate and with bound feet, was handpicked by his mother. Lu Xun possibly never consummated this marriage, although he took care of her material needs all his life.
In 1904, Lu Xun joined the Revive China Society (Guangfuhui, or Kuang Fu Hui) and joined other Chinese students in Japan in a movement to overthrow the Qing dynasty.
Sendai
In 1906, Lu Xun decided to transfer from medical studies to literature. In the Preface to Nahan, his first story collection, he revealed why he gave up pursuing a medical career. One day after class, one of his Japanese instructors screened a lantern slide documenting the imminent execution of an alleged Chinese spy during the Russo-Japanese War, 1904-05. Lu Xun was shocked by the apathy of the Chinese onlookers; he decided it was more important to cure his compatriots' spiritual ills rather their physical diseases.
Career
While studying in Japan, Lu Xun wrote several essays on the natural sciences and world literature, and translated patriotic works from other oppressed countries. In 1909, he published these stories as Stories from Other Lands, with some of the translation done by his brother, Zhou Zuoren. In the summer of that year, Lu Xun returned to China and taught at the Zhejiang Normal School. He then became dean and later principal of the Shaoxing Middle School.
After the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Revolution of 1911, Lu Xun wrote an essay in classical Chinese, Remembering the Past. In 1912, when the Republic established its provisional government, he became a member of the Ministry of Education. He moved to Beijing with the republican government, but quickly became disillusioned by the government’s inability to control warlordism. The October Revolution in Russia in 1917 introduced Luxun to the ideas of Marxism and Leninism.
From 1918 until 1927, Lu Xun taught at Beijing University, Beijing Girls’ Normal College, Xiamen University, and Sun Yat Sen University in Guangzhou (Canton), and continued to produce short stories. In 1927, Chiang Kai Shek ordered the massacre of Chinese Communists in Shanghai and other cities. Some of Lu Xun’s students at Sun Yat Sen University were arrested and executed. Unable to save them, Lu Xun resigned his teaching post in protest and moved to Shanghai, where he lived until his death.
In Shanghai, Lu Xun studied Marxist-Leninist thought and joined the Chinese Communist revolution. In 1930, he became a founder of the China Freedom League and the China League of Left-Wing Writers, a movement subscribing to socialist realism, the idea that art should portray contemporary events and social problems as they really are, in order to give hope for a better society in the future.
In 1933, Lu Xun participated in the founding of the China league for Civil Rights, along with Soong Qingling, the widow of Sun Yat Sen, and other activists. He helped organize an International Anti-Imperialist, Anti-Fascist Conference in Shanghai and presided as honorary chairman.[2]
Lu Xun died in Shanghai on October 19, 1936. His remains were interred in a mausoleum within Lu Xun Park in Shanghai, where a Lu Xun Museum exists today.
Works
Between 1918 and 1924, Lu Xun produced twenty-five short stories, published as Wandering (Pang Huang; 彷徨; 1926) and Call to Arms. From 1924 to 1926, Lu wrote essays of ironic reminiscences, published in 1928 as Zhaohua Xishi (朝花夕拾, Dawn Dew-light Collected at Dusk), as well as the collection of prose poems, Ye Cao (野草, Wild Grass, published 1927).
Zhongguo Xiaoshuo Lueshi (中國小說略史, A Concise History of Chinese Fiction) was written in 1924, revised and published in 1930, and translated into English in 1959. A comprehensive overview of history of Chinese fiction, drawn from his lectures as at Peking University, it was the first work of its kind in China. It covered Chinese fiction from ancient myths and legends through the early modern fiction of the Qing dynasty.
Lu Xun was also the editor of several left-wing magazines such as New Youth (新青年, Xin Qingnian) and Sprouts (萌芽, Meng Ya). He was the brother of another important Chinese political figure and essayist Zhou Zuoren. He was among the early supporters of the Esperanto movement in China.
