The common belief that the Great Wall of China is one of the few man-made structures visible from space is incorrect. Because the wall closely resembles the natural stone and soil around it, it's hard to see with the naked eye even from low Earth orbit, and it doesn't stand out in most orbital photographs. Nonetheless, this fact does not diminish the significance of this remarkable ancient construction.

For thousands of years, Chinese leaders initiated wall-building endeavors to defend their lands from northern, nomadic invaders. A section in Shandong province, made from compressed soil known as "rammed earth," is believed to be around 2,500 years old. Before China's unification, these walls protected the borders during the Warring States Period.

Around 220 B.C.E., Qin Shi Huang or the First Emperor of China united the country and linked the existing walls into a single structure. Initially composed mostly of rammed earth and wood, successive emperors fortified and lengthened the wall, targeting protection against northern incursions. While some sections feature brick construction, others consist of quarried granite or marble. The wall continuously incorporated new building techniques over time.

Zhu Yuanzhang, who rose to power as the Hongwu Emperor in 1368 C.E. and initiated the Ming Dynasty, is renowned for advancements in ceramics and painting. The Ming emperors enhanced the wall with watchtowers and platforms. The popular imagery of the Great Wall that we recognize today mostly shows Ming-era construction in stone. The total length of the wall is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,500 kilometers (2,500 to 3,400 miles), depending on how it is measured.

In the 17th century, the Manchu emperors expanded Chinese territory into Inner Mongolia, which reduced the wall's strategic importance. Nevertheless, it continues to be a potent symbol of Chinese heritage and culture. The Great Wall sees numerous visitors annually and is celebrated as a masterpiece on Earth, despite its invisibility from space.
