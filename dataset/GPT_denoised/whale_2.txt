Maybe the World's Loneliest Whale Isn't So Lonely After All

The peculiar song was first detected in 1989, by a classified network of sensors called hydrophones that were scattered across the floor of the Puget Sound by the Navy. Intended to monitor Soviet submarines, when the network was partly declassified, researchers repurposed it to eavesdrop on oceanic sounds, which is far from quiet. On December 7, 1992, a technician spotted what seemed to be a whale's call, but at an unusual frequency of 52 hertz. Leslie Jamison notes in "52 Blue" from Atavist (excerpted by Slate):

At 52 hertz, the signal was unexpectedly high for a blue whale, which typically vocalizes between 15 and 20 hertz, barely within the human hearing range. Yet, this was a clear audio record of an apparently lone creature traversing the Pacific with its distinctive pitch.

The unique frequency drew attention from scientists, media, and the curious public, coining it the 52 hertz whale or 52 blue. Kate Stafford, a researcher at the National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, explained to the New York Times’ Andrew Revkin that the existence of this whale for at least a dozen years in such a tough environment means it is healthy, despite the solitary connotations of its song.

The sound clip of 52's song, accelerated for better audibility:

This whale is often considered the most solitary in the world, sparking a Kickstarter campaign dedicated to locating it. Despite numerous recordings, the whale itself remains unseen, and its cries travel vast distances in the ocean.

Bill Watkins, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, analyzed over a decade's worth of recordings, confirming the whale's distinctiveness. However, the idea of its loneliness is debated among researchers.

Chris Baranuik reports for BBC Nature:

Christopher Willes Clark of Cornell University raised doubts about the whale's uniqueness based on his 1993 recordings. Given that whales in certain areas have dialects and various unique calls have been documented, the 52Hz whale doesn't appear entirely singular.

Moreover, Clark and others challenge the assumption that this whale cannot communicate with ordinary blue whales that emit lower frequencies. "The animal's singing shares many features with a conventional blue whale song," he asserts, concluding that related species like blue whales, fin whales, and humpback whales can hear these calls; the whale is simply unusual.

The whale's sex or species is still unknown, with speculations of it being a hybrid. Stafford infers from its behavioral patterns and migratory routes that it might be at least partially a blue whale.

The anomalous call might even be attributed to more than one whale. In 2010, sensors off the California coast detected similar calls that imply the existence of multiple singing animals, as noted by John Hildebrand of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

A thorough investigation is required to determine the true nature of the 52 hertz song—whether it belongs to a solitary individual or a group of hybrids. Until then, we continue to wonder and attune our ears to the ocean's depths.
