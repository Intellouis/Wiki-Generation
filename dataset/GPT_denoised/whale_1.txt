The search for the world's loneliest whale began when people discovered that it communicated at a higher pitch than other whales, leading to the question of whether it was heard by its kind or if its calls went unanswered, symbolizing loneliness.

The world's loneliest whale resides in the North Pacific, where for over 30 years, scientists have intermittently tracked it. They've listened to its unique calls as it traverses the ocean, hoping in vain for a response. Though a recent documentary aimed to uncover the reality, it turns out that a whale struggling to communicate might not be so rare.

The story began in the cold war era when the US military's deployment of an underwater hydrophone network to detect Soviet submarines incidentally captured strange noises, including mysterious low-frequency moans. Later recognized as calls from blue and fin whales, this network eventually served whale researchers post-cold war. William Watkins, a marine mammal acoustics expert, spotted a distinctive call among the usual blue and fin whale sounds—the call of a whale vocalizing at 52Hz, unusually high for these massive creatures.

Watkins' team monitored this whale for over a decade, and their 2004 research on underwater sound systems gained media attention, stirring public curiosity about the whale's unique frequency. People pondered if the whale could hear or be heard by others, whether its solitary calls signified actual loneliness.

The whale's plight sparked a creative outpouring: poetry, plays, artwork, even a parody social media profile. It resonated with those feeling isolated, like a musician who composed an album influenced by the whale, and a filmmaker who found solace in the whale's story during a personal crisis. In 2015, K-pop band BTS released a song about the whale, capturing its solitary existence in their lyrics.

Researchers have tried to tag the whale to further understand the situation of the 52Hz whale.

However, scientists like Christopher Clark of Cornell University and Ana Širović of Texas A&M University at Galveston question the assumption of the whale's loneliness, noting that other whales can indeed hear it, despite its unusual call.

Documentary filmmaker Joshua Zeman was captivated by the story and decided to create a film not just about the whale but also those compelled by its story. Zeman embarked on a mission to locate the whale, raising $400,000 on Kickstarter for a challenging expedition.

Despite initial doubts about the whale's survival, a fortunate discovery by an intern suggested the whale was alive, now possibly close to the Californian coast. However, the region's heavy shipping traffic posed a new obstacle, with ship noise impairing the scientists' ability to hear marine life, including their whale.

The documentary culminates in a startling revelation that prompts more questions yet seems to dispel the myth of the whale's loneliness.

To uncover this discovery, one must watch the film. It powerfully reminds us that while we were concerned about one lonely whale, the relentless sea traffic has rendered countless whales unheard, isolated by the clamor of global trade.
