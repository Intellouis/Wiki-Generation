Lu Xun, born September 25, 1881, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, China, and died October 19, 1936, in Shanghai, is a prominent Chinese writer, widely regarded as the foremost in 20th-century Chinese literature. An influential critic, Lu Xun is known for his incisive essays on China's historical traditions and modern conditions.

Youth
Zhou Shuren, born into a traditionally esteemed and wealthy family, enjoyed a happy childhood until 1893, when events took a drastic turn. His grandfather, a former official in Beijing, was imprisoned for examination fraud, and his father became seriously ill. With the family's reputation tarnished, they faced scorn from both community and relatives. These tribulations significantly influenced Zhou Shuren's writing, imbuing it with a recognizable sensitivity and pessimism.

In 1899, Zhou Shuren left his hometown to attend a mining school in Nanjing, sparking an interest in Darwin's theory of evolution, which later heavily influenced his work. Darwinism at the time prompted Chinese intellectuals to undertake social reform and favored modernity over tradition. By 1902, Zhou was in Japan studying medicine and supporting the Chinese revolutionary movement. He began writing articles for Chinese student-run radical magazines in 1903 and entered an arranged marriage in 1905. Two years later, he and his brother Zhou Zuoren translated and published a two-volume collection of 19th-century European stories, aiming to inspire revolutionary spirit, but it failed to draw public interest. Disenchanted, Zhou returned to China that same year.

Literary Career
After teaching in Shaoxing and serving as a low-level Beijing official, Lu Xun shifted back to writing in 1918, aligning himself with the emerging Chinese literary movement. Urged by friends, he published the acclaimed short story "Diary of a Madman," a scathing critique of Confucian culture viewed as cannibalistic by the madman narrator. This pivotal piece, the first Western-style story crafted in colloquial Chinese, brought the short story medium into the limelight. His novelette, "The True Story of Ah Q," blended humor and sorrow to criticize the old order and introduced "Ah Q-ism" to the lexicon, symbolizing the tendency to claim "spiritual victory" in the face of defeat. These works, along with others collected in "Nahan" (Call to Arms) and "Panghuang" (Wandering), solidified Lu Xun's status as China's premier writer. His unique symbolic prose poems, recollections, and retold classical tales in the collection "Yecao" (Wild Grass) showcased a modern, satirical wit.

Throughout the 1920s, Lu Xun taught at universities in Beijing, exploring Chinese writing and literature. His scholarly text "Zhongguo xiaoshuo shilue" (A Brief History of Chinese Fiction) remains authoritative, as do his classical fiction compilations and Russian translations.

Despite his renown, Lu Xun battled a growing cynicism about Chinese society, exacerbated by personal and professional strains. His opposition to Zhou Zuoren, a conflict with the government, and marital discord deepened his despair, leading to his concept of "resistance of despair," a key element of his philosophy.

Shanghai Years
Compelled to leave Beijing in 1926 due to political and personal strife, Lu Xun settled in Shanghai in 1927, cohabiting with Xu Guangping, his former student, with whom he had a son two years later. Refocusing his efforts from fiction to satirical essays, he used writing as a political statement. In 1930, as the titular head of the League of Left-Wing Writers, he saw the Chinese communists as his nation's hope. Though he never joined the Chinese Communist Party, he played a crucial role as a fellow traveler, enlisting writers and citizens for the cause through Marxist literary translations and his own political essays.

In his final years, with most of his work banned, Lu Xun continued to publish under pseudonyms, critiquing both the Shanghai communists for their propagandist leanings and being targeted by their members politically. In 1934, he described his stance as hengzhan, symbolizing the intellectual's plight, battling the extremes of right and left, conservatism and forced evolution.

Posthumously, the Chinese communist movement hailed Lu Xun as a Socialist Realism paragon. His works feature in school curricula, and the Lu Xun Museum in Shanghai preserves his personal artifacts and writings. English translations of his works exist, including "Silent China: Selected Writings of Lu Xun" and "Diary of a Madman and Other Stories."

Zhou Zuoren, born January 16, 1885, in Shaoxing, and died May 6, 1967, in Beijing, was a leading Chinese essayist, critic, and literary scholar. Recognized for his translations of global fiction and myths into vernacular Chinese, he remains an influential essayist of the 1920s and 1930s.

Educated classically, Zhou Zuoren, alongside his brother Lu Xun, moved to Japan in 1906 to study languages and literature. They translated and disseminated European fiction to encourage the Chinese populace toward rebellion against oppressive regimes.

Zhou returned to China in 1911, joining Peking University in 1917 and gaining fame through his essays. He called for language reform, vernacular usage, and endorsed “humane” literature, admiring Western realism. His foreign literature translations advanced his renown.

During the Sino-Japanese War, Zhou's work with a Japanese-sponsored institution led to post-war convictions for collaboration. His death sentence commuted to imprisonment and pardoned in 1949, he resumed his research in Beijing under the communist regime.
