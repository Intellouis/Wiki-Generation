Recent viral Internet posts suggest the "52 hertz whale", often referred to as the world's loneliest whale, might have found a companion.

The 52 hertz whale is known for its unique call, discovered by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1989. This call, detected across the Pacific Ocean, exhibits a frequency of 52 hertz, which is higher than any whale species known to match its migration pattern. It shows similarities to blue whale movements, yet blue whales typically range from 10 to 39 Hz, with dominant frequencies between 16 and 28 Hz, according to Cornell University's bioacoustics research program.

"The sound source has been the only one with this call structure in the entire listening area," reported the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2000. "We have been tracking this call since 1992 and have not identified the whale species, possibly suggesting it is a hybrid."

The whale's continuous calls over the years imply that its unique communication has not negatively affected its survival, despite no detected responses.

The whale captured global interest, leading to a Twitter parody account and even a song by Korean group BTS, titled "Whalien 52."

Regarding the speculation that the 52 hertz whale has found a friend, this stems from observations in 2010 when sensors off California's coast detected a similar call pattern, potentially from more than one animal. However, this evidence was not conclusive, and no further indications of another whale with a matching call have been reported since then.

As for the whale's loneliness, Christopher Clark of Cornell's Bioacoustics Research Program suggests the whale might be understood by other blue whales, despite regional dialect differences. Clark explains that the whale's song shares features with typical blue whale songs, implying it could be recognized by other whales.

In the 2021 documentary "The Loneliest Whale: The Search for 52," directed by Joshua Zeman, an exciting discovery suggested a potential happy conclusion to this story. Initially believing the whale was deceased due to a lack of recent detections, Zeman's team found the distinctive song off Los Angeles's west coast. The documentary's epilogue hints at a sighting of a possible blue-fin whale hybrid, a rare but documented phenomenon, that could be the source of the 52 hertz calls.
