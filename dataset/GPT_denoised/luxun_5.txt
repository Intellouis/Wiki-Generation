Early Life
Born on September 25, 1881, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Lu Xun came from a wealthy and well-educated family. His grandfather was implicated and nearly executed for bribery when Lu Xun was a child, leading to the family's decline in social status. The changed attitude of neighbors towards his family after their fall significantly impacted the young Lu Xun.

After traditional Chinese remedies were unable to save his father from an illness likely tuberculosis, Lu Xun resolved to study Western medicine in Japan. An incident where he witnessed a Chinese prisoner being executed by Japanese soldiers while other Chinese onlookers showed indifference led him to abandon medicine. Lu Xun decided to focus on writing, believing that the mindset of the Chinese people needed healing more than their physical ailments.

Socio-Political Beliefs
Lu Xun's writing career began with the May 4th Movement, a campaign by young intellectuals aiming to modernize China by incorporating Western ideas and practices. His critically incisive writing, which supported modernization and critiqued Chinese tradition, made him a prominent figure in the movement.

Impact on the Communist Party
While Lu Xun's work has been adopted by the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong admired him but also ensured that Lu Xun's critical style wasn’t applied to the Party. Lu Xun died before the Communist revolution, so his opinion on it is unknown.

National and International Influence
Lu Xun is hailed as one of China's greatest and most influential writers. His socially-critical works continue to be widely read and referenced in China. His stories are still part of the national curriculum and have influenced contemporary Chinese and international writers, including Nobel Prize laureate Kenzaburō Ōe, who called him "the greatest writer Asia produced in the twentieth century."

Noted Works
Lu Xun's "A Madman’s Diary" (1918) gained fame for its use of colloquial language and its critical perspective on Chinese adherence to tradition, likened to cannibalism through metaphor. "The True Story of Ah-Q", a satirical novella, critiques the Chinese mindset through its protagonist Ah-Q, a delusional peasant whose behavior coined the term "the Ah-Q spirit", still in use today. Besides short fiction, Lu Xun's legacy includes translations, critical essays, and poems. His total works encompass 20 volumes, amounting to over 60 pounds.

Selected Translated Works
Two prominent works, "A Madman's Diary" and "The True Story of Ah-Q", are available in translation. Other translations include "The New Year's Sacrifice", which tackles women's rights and the perils of complacency, and "My Old Home", a contemplative story about memory and our connection with the past.
