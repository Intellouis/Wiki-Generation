Great Wall of China, near Beijing.
Great Wall of China, eastern Asia, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.
Great Wall of China, expansive fortification built in ancient China, stands as one of the largest construction projects executed. It comprises multiple walls—some parallel to each other—built across northern China and southern Mongolia for over two thousand years. The most complete and well-preserved section from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) stretches about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) from Mount Hu near Dandong, southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province. The structure often follows hill and mountain ridges, and roughly one-fourth of its length utilizes natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges. Around 70 percent of the total length includes constructed walls, while the remaining parts are ditches or moats. Even in disrepair or vanished in places, it remains one of Earth’s most remarkable structures. UNESCO recognized the Great Wall as a World Heritage site in 1987.

Overview of the Great Wall of China.
The Great Wall at Shanhaiguan, Hebei province, marks the traditional eastern end of the wall which stretches about 4,160 miles (6,700 km) without its branches. Research in the 1990s exposed sections in Liaoning, and recent aerial and satellite surveys have confirmed its continuous stretch through much of the province. The Ming Wall's increased length was documented in 2009.

Construction history begins with the several individual walls built by Chinese states from the 7th to 4th century BCE to protect against neighbors and barbarian invasions. States like Chu, Qi, Zhongshan, Wei, and Zhao erected walls that varied in construction, using local materials like earth, stone, and wood.

In c. 220 B.C., Qin Shi Huang linked several existing defensive structures into a united defense system against northern incursions. Construction lasted until the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).

During the Han dynasty, the Great Wall strengthened as defense and contributed to northern farmlands and trade routes along the Silk Road. Restoration and extensions continued during subsequent dynasties, adapting to the political and military needs of the time. The Great Wall has been repaired for commerce control and rebellion threats, reflecting the changing dynamics of China's history.

Ming rulers extensively maintained and fortified the Great Wall against Mongolian invasions, building on earlier walls erected by the Bei Qi and Bei Wei. Strategic fortresses called “passes” and signal towers were constructed along it, integrating military communications and troop movement directions.

Under the Qing dynasty, repairs lessened as a result of a pacification policy towards Mongolia and Tibet. The wall's military significance decreased, and it began to fall into disrepair.

Today, the Great Wall embodies Chinese mythology and emblematic significance, seen in its reflection as a national symbol. Despite past neglect and damage, restoration efforts at various sections, including at Badaling, Shanhai Pass, and Mutianyu, have revitalized parts of the wall. It continues to be both a historical site and a testament to human engineering, drawing tourists from around the globe.
