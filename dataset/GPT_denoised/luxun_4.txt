Zhou Shuren, better known by his pen name Lu Xun (Traditional Chinese: 魯迅; Simplified Chinese: 鲁迅; pinyin: Lǔ Xùn; Wade-Giles: Lu Hsün), was born on September 25, 1881, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China, and died on October 19, 1936, at the age of 55. As a leading literary figure in 20th-century China, he was instrumental in developing modern baihua (白話, Chinese vernacular) literature. His roles spanned novelist, short story writer, editor, translator, critic, and essayist. He co-founded the China League of Left-Wing Writers in Shanghai.

Born into a scholarly family during the Qing dynasty, Lu Xun was exposed to both the privilege of education and the struggles of peasants early on. He studied medicine in Japan but realized his writings could better serve the Chinese people. His work often criticized Confucianism and feudalism and included his renowned story "The True Story of Ah Q" (阿Q正傳), published in 1923. His lucid and engaging style greatly influenced Chinese writers to come, and after the May Fourth Movement, Mao Zedong posthumously praised him.

Lu Xun was first named Zhou Zhangshu and later renamed Zhou Shuren (樹人; "to nurture a person"). The early loss of his father to illness fueled his interest in medicine. Through education, he encountered Western learning and eventually shifted his focus from medicine to literature, drawing inspiration from witnessing a Chinese spy's execution in Japan. His writing career in Japan produced essays on natural sciences and literature, as well as translations promoting patriotism. Returning to China, he became a respected educator and principal at Shaoxing Middle School. Disenchanted with the early Republic's governance, he embraced Marxist and Leninist ideas following the 1917 October Revolution in Russia.

Lu Xun’s writing during this influential period included the significant baihua tale "A Madman’s Diary" (狂人日記, 1918) and a set of 25 stories comprising "Wandering" and "Call to Arms." He advocated for literature that spoke to the people's language and experiences, aligning with the May Fourth Movement's ethos.

After the 1927 Shanghai Massacre of Chinese Communists, Lu Xun resigned from his teaching post and settled in Shanghai. There he engaged with Marxist-Leninist thought, contributed to the Chinese Communist cause, and supported socialist realism in the arts. He helped establish the China Freedom League and the China League of Left-Wing Writers. Lu Xun passed away in Shanghai, his remains entombed in Lu Xun Park, which also houses a museum.

Lu Xun’s extensive body of works includes more than nine hundred publications spanning fiction, essays, and criticisms. His analysis of the "Chinese national character" has been seminal, although he never joined the Communist Party. His wit and incisive commentary continue to hold significance. His works, once banned in Taiwan due to his leftist leanings, are now widely recognized and part of educational curricula, including in Japan.

Notable works by Lu Xun include his contribution to modern literature, his advocacy for Esperanto, and his editing of leftist magazines. His translated and original literary works, like "A Concise History of Chinese Fiction" and "Wild Grass," remain important readings in understanding China's cultural evolution. Despite his complex views on individualism and collectivism, Lu Xun endures as a powerful voice in Chinese literature.
