Montezuma's Revenge

It must be somewhat frustrating for the Indiana Jones franchise that its representation on the Commodore 64 is subpar. With at least four games ranging from terrible to just plain odd and not very good, it's especially irritating considering there are at least two quality games not bearing the Indiana Jones name that could have. One is Rick Dangerous, and the other is Montezuma's Revenge. They may be joined by another relative only available on PC for now; Rocky Memphis and the Temple of Ophuxoff.

Creating a simple yet brain- and memory-challenging game should not be difficult, considering Indy was both an action hero and an archaeology professor. Luckily, Montezuma's Revenge, released in 1984, excelled in providing fun and outshone most of its competition.

The game's exploratory nature adds to the enjoyment. With the freedom to navigate as long as you can unlock necessary doors, the game expands as you progress, sometimes requiring backtracking with the right key for previously encountered doors. Montezuma's Revenge is devoid of time constraints, eliminating unnecessary stress amidst avoiding hazards. Monty's attack options are limited to picking up swords or knives to defeat an enemy or using rare items that temporally neutralize enemies. Aside from that, he must depend on his agility, which is quite exceptional.

Thereâ€™s a freeing sensation in playing this game, even though it mainly involves opening doors with matching keys. Monty navigates well, and any mistake made won't likely be repeated, barring reflex, concentration, or memory errors. It's a fair challenge that rewards careful timing and room analysis.

The early eighties graphics give Monty a distinctive, chunky appearance, but his animations are fast and fluid, enabling swift and accurate movement, despite occasional frustrations with precision jumps and some quirky platforming logic.

However, given its a single-load game, some stages tend to be reused with slight alterations in enemy placements, key distributions, and variably existent obstacles, which may make the game feel repetitive at times. Despite this, Montezuma's Revenge remains a remarkable game that retains much of its charm.
