The Great Wall of China stretches across China's northern borders like a colossal dragon. It’s an imposing architectural feat and considered one of the greatest manmade wonders. The history of the Great Wall dates back over 2,000 years, yet it was only recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.

However, the Great Wall is not just one wall.

“The first thing to note,” says travel expert Stan Godwyn, “is that it’s a series of walls and fortifications.”

Godwyn often suggests visitors check out Badaling (most accessible), Mutianyu (popular and well-restored), Simatai (rugged), and Jinshanling (for serious hikers).

Why Was the Great Wall of China Built?

How Was the Great Wall of China Built?
The Wall is not a single structure but includes multiple fortifications, some parallel, others circular or side walls, and natural barriers like rivers or mountains.

China's states first built early defenses against one another with earth, wood, and stone. Ming dynasty constructors mainly used brick, particularly in foundations and gateways.

Over a million soldiers, laborers, prisoners, and animals were recruited for the construction, with many perishing during the grueling labor. Rumors persist that some were buried within the Wall, but evidence remains elusive.

Primitive technology, like wheelbarrows and pulley systems, alongside manual labor, were instrumental in building the Wall's oldest sections.
