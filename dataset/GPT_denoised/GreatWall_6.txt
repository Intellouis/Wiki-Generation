The Great Wall of China is a fortification in northern China extending 13,171 miles (21,196 km) from Jiayuguan Pass in the west to Hushan Mountains in Liaoning Province in the east, terminating at the Bohai Gulf. It spans eleven provinces/municipalities and two autonomous regions (Inner Mongolia and Ningxia).

The construction began in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) under Emperor Shi Huangdi (r. 221-210 BCE) and extended through several dynasties. The current structure is largely the result of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1664 CE), which added watchtowers and reinforced the wall's length and width. It deteriorated after the Ming Dynasty as the succeeding Qing Dynasty (1644-1912 CE) expanded China's borders northwards, rendering the wall obsolete. Conservation efforts commenced seriously in the 1980s, and UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 1987.

The Original Wall
The Warring States Period (c. 481-221 BCE) led to the Qin state's victory, with King Ying Zheng, later known as `Qin Shi Huangdi' (First Emperor), conquering the other states.

Shi Huangdi ordered the wall's construction to unify his empire and defend against the Xiongnu nomads from Mongolia, eradicating the walls that previously divided the warring states.

The original wall, constructed by conscripts and convicts, traced a northern border different from today's wall and was not seen as a proud national symbol by its builders.

The Ming Dynasty Wall
The original Qin wall has mostly vanished. After the Qin Dynasty's fall, the Han Dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE) continued wall construction, which later facilitated trade along the Silk Road.

The Ming Dynasty built upon this, constructing over 25,000 watchtowers and giving the wall its recognizable dimensions to prevent Mongolian invasions.

The Liaoning Wall
The Ming Dynasty also built the Liaoning Wall, an earth and stone defensive barrier to protect Liaoning Province from northern invasions. Controversy arose when a section near the North Korean border was claimed by both China and North Korea.

Ultimately, neither the Liaoning Wall nor the Great Wall successfully repelled invasions, evidenced when the Manchus breached the wall in 1644, leading to the Qing Dynasty's establishment.

Modern Day Preservation & the Moon Fallacy
Concerted preservation efforts in recent times began around 1980, with UNESCO designating the wall as a World Heritage Site in 1987. However, many misconceptions about the Great Wall persist, such as its visibility from space or its inclusion as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. While these are not true, the Great Wall was selected as one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the New 7 Wonders Foundation in 2007, and it attracts millions of visitors annually.
