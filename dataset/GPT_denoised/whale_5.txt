Inside the Nail-Biting Quest to Find the 'Loneliest Whale'
By Pakinam Amer on September 28, 2021

It's a tale of sound: the song of a solitary whale that vocalizes at a unique frequency of 52 hertz, which apparently no other whale can understand.

It's also a tale about science and ocean life, infused with fantasy and mystery and enshrouded in darkness.

The whale, of unknown species and nicknamed “52,” was first detected in 1989 and has been intermittently monitored by scientists since. Its solitary nature puzzled marine researchers, and its existence entranced millions.

Yet, as 52 traverses the oceanic abyss, much about it remains a mystery. It has never been seen in person.

Scientists believe the whale is a large male, possibly a hybrid. They speculate that its unusual song—too low for humans and too high for whales—might be due to a malformation.

Scientific American spoke with Josh Zeman, an award-winning filmmaker who created a documentary about 52, to discuss not only his remarkable cinematic journey (impressive and beautifully filmed) but the science and academic partnerships that propelled it.

The documentary—written and directed by Zeman and executive produced by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Adrian Grenier—draws inspiration from the late bioacoustics scientist William Watkins's findings. Driven by passion and curiosity, it uses underwater acoustics to track 52 through the cacophonous, sound-rich ocean.

For Zeman, a departure from his usual genre, the film maintains an air of mystery and detective work similar to whodunits. It unfolds like a classic true-crime tale, reflecting Zeman's background as an investigative reporter and true-crime documentarian.

At the time Zeman began the film, 52 had been missing and silent for years. Essentially, Zeman reopened a cold case to, in his words, "set the record straight" and immerse the audience in the whale's world.

With marine scientists, he pursued streams of whale songs and other auditory clues, listening, analyzing, and methodically closing in on 52. Zeman found him, lost him, and found him again, leading to an unexpected revelation.

The discovery might not be the closure Zeman hoped to offer viewers, but it is certainly a new chapter in this evolving story.

Zeman remains hopeful other storytellers will continue uncovering truths about 52.

“What a beautiful gift to say, ‘Actually, there’s another chapter.’ And then, 20 years later, someone else adds their chapter,” he says. "That's storytelling."

[Whale Call]

Pakinam Amer: A lone sound from a unique source broadcast at a frequency of 50 to 52 Hertz. Imperceptible to human ears, too high for whales, leaving a trail of acoustic data across the Pacific.

First detected in 1989, the mysterious thrum emanated from surveillance hydrophones installed by the US Navy during the cold war to detect Soviet submarines.

Initially presumed mechanical, possibly an enemy vessel, it wasn't until years later that the signals were shared with William Watkins, which gave shape to our understanding of this enigmatic whale.

They simply named it, 52.

The creature seemed to vocalize at a frequency unmatched by any marine animal, without response or understanding.

From 1992 to 2004, Watkins, a bioacoustics expert, and his team at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution tracked and recorded 52-Hz calls.

Still, it remained unseen.

For 12 years, 52's sonic signature stood as the sole evidence of a whale that seemed to vanish and reappear annually during mating season in the central and eastern North Pacific.

Bill Watkins died in 2004 at 78, never knowing 52’s complete story.

His work, though, resurfaced posthumously, confirming the whale's solitary seafaring existence.

52's calls didn’t resonate with others. It communicated in a composite dialect similar to blue and fin whales, yet spoke to neither.

The solitary deep-sea dweller soon sparked further research and conjecture.

It evolved into a symbol upon which we projected tales of existential loneliness, imbuing it with our sorrows and seeking deeper meaning.

To us, 52 became the "world's loneliest whale."

Determined to be male, it inspired poetry, art, social media presence, and even a BTS song.

Yet, for many, 52 remained an imagined presence, a spectral entity rather than a flesh-and-blood reality.

The questions of its loneliness and quest for companionship mirror our reflections on whether whales experience isolation as we do.

Today, we discuss a filmmaker's expedition to confront these questions and unveil the truth about 52.

Amer: That's Josh Zeman, who documented the pursuit of a whale across the vast Pacific, culminating in a film as unpredictable as the existence of the whale itself.

Josh Zeman: It's not just the story of a lone creature, it represents humanity's existential crisis, our loneliness, translated into the form of a whale.

Amer: In his search, Josh utilized bioacoustic research to distinguish a single whale amid pods and maritime noise.

Decades have passed since Watkins and others tracked 52 intermittently._relu

Josh's endeavor stands out for its investigative rigor and scientific exploration, employing sonar, drones, and acoustic recording packages to narrate the odyssey.

Zeman: Initially captivated by an emotional connection, I discovered a creature that awakened creativity and inspiration universally.

Amer: The film delves into the history of underwater acoustic surveillance technology, blending science and geopolitical narratives.

Zeman: The project blossomed beyond an emotional tale into a deeper understanding of bioacoustics and oceanic soundscapes.

Amer: Despite challenges and the unknowns of whether 52 was still alive, Josh persevered with the scientists, bolstered by public support, and launched a successful Kickstarter for the expedition.

Zeman: We journeyed not only for a potential encounter but to share a story that resonated deeply with people.

Amer: The film reveals 52 as a hybrid, confirming scientific speculation about its distinct calls and origin.

Zeman: This emphasizes the nuances of communication and belonging, not isolation.

Amer: In an ocean cluttered with human-made noise, tracking 52 was arduous.

Zeman: We showcased the impact of ocean noise pollution and the echo of our consumerism on marine life.

Amer: Amidst global shipping traffic, the search for 52 became fraught with near losses, yet never witnessed in reality.

Zeman: Finishing Watkins' legacy, the film hints at the presence of not just one unique whale but potentially multiple.

Amer: As ocean noise escalates, the challenge of marine communication grows, possibly leading to an increase in solitary whales.

Zeman: We are inadvertently creating an ocean of lonely whales.

Amer: Josh Zeman’s film “The Loneliest Whale” is available on Amazon, Apple TV, and other platforms, with production by DiCaprio and Grenier.
