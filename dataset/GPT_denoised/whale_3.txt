Exploration Mysteries: The World's Loneliest Whale

Since the 1980s, a solitary call has resonated through the Pacific Ocean. Known as "the world's loneliest whale," this creature swims through the ocean depths seeking companionship, broadcasting its location at a unique frequency of 52Hz. This call has puzzled scientists, as the whale has not been seen and its species remains unknown.

The U.S. Navy first detected the 52Hz call in 1989. Using hydrophones to monitor submarines, they heard what seemed like a loud, mournful moan of non-human origin, later identified as a whale. Unlike typical whale calls, this one was atypical.

Each species has a unique vocalization pattern, like a fingerprint to identify them. For instance, blue whales vocalize between 10 and 40Hz, fin whales at 20Hz, and sperm whale clicks reach 10,000Hz. The 52Hz call is distinct because no other species communicates at that frequency, and its repetition patterns are shorter and more erratic. The call contains elements of both fin and blue whales.

From its sounds, scientists have inferred the whale's migration patterns, similar to those of blue whales, yet occurring in seasons that match fin whales. The whale, known as 52, confines its calling to the Pacific, audible from August to December before silence sets in, an almost yearly pattern.

The probable explanation is that 52 is a hybrid between a blue and a fin whale. Hybrids, though rare, do happen, as evidenced by a potential sighting off Dana Point, California, in 2021. The hybrid, named Flue by locals, suggests that 52 is not solitary. It is likely a male, who would typically broadcast calls to attract females.

Despite other possible hybrids, 52's 52Hz call is the only one recordedâ€”perhaps due to the limited pickup by hydrophones. Christopher Clark of Cornell University notes that while other whales can hear this unique call, they may simply not understand it, leading to no response.

Some speculate that 52's uniqueness could be due to a deformity or deafness, but only a sighting will confirm this. There was a period when the calls ceased, leading scientists to fear 52's death, yet the calls eventually resumed.

Efforts to find 52 continue, with Joshua Zeman producing a documentary, "The Loneliest Whale: The Search for 52" (2021), including his discovery of two 52Hz calls and footage of possible hybrids near California, hinting that 52 might have company after all.

Since then, 52's calls have shifted to 49Hz, which may signify aging and suggest a potential further decrease with time.

Summing up the evidence, it appears 52Hz Whale is a reticent blue-fin hybrid. However, the current state of the oceans, busier and noisier than ever, might be hindering the detection of similar creatures, thereby complicating the search. 

Joshua Zeman metaphorically relates the 52Hz whale to human loneliness, a sentiment that resonates globally, creating an emotional bond with the whale. With recent discoveries suggesting that 52 may not be alone, hope remains for a story with a positive outcome.
