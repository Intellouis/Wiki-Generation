Lu Xun: China's Greatest Modern Writer
Lu Xun (or Lu Hsun, pronounced "Lu Shun"; 1881-1936) has been regarded as China's greatest modern writer throughout most of the 20th century. While many other authors of social criticism fiction popular in the 1920s and 1930s have faced partial discredit or criticism due to political movements in China after 1949, Lu Xun's stature has consistently remained eminent. Mao Zedong (1893-1976) referred to him as "commander of China's cultural revolution."

Lu Xun's early death in the Communist movement perhaps shielded him from the political "errors" criticism his contemporaries endured. However, the intricate complexity and multiple interpretations of his writing style also contribute significantly to his preeminence. Renowned as an essayist, Lu Xun's acclaim primarily comes from his short stories. Writers in the 1920s and 1930s were greatly troubled by China's social and political turmoil. Some devotedly followed an ideological movement and authored propagandistic works advocating revolution. The sternest revolutionary literature sacrificed literary quality for political messages, focusing more on political remedies than on authentic characters, convincing situations, or profound insights into the human condition. Conversely, some writers, unsure of the right solution, expressed the Chinese dilemma in their fiction to incite readers' awareness for the need to rectify such degradation and corruption.

Lu Xun, however, followed neither path explicitly. In the early 1920s, skeptic of radical social reform outcomes in China, he avoided depicting idealized revolutionary protagonists or scenarios in his work. Conversely, he transcended mere delicate portrayals of Chinese distress. Rather, through striking analogies and hyperbolic characters, Lu Xun delivered his unique perspective on Chinese society. The power and somberness of his vision engender a poignant and unsettling reading experience.

About the Author

The pen name Lu Xun was adopted by Zhou Shuren (Chou Shu-jen), born in 1881 into a Confucian family. His grandfather was a high-ranking official in Beijing, and his father was a scholar. Yet, Lu Xun's childhood was marred by difficulty. He faced the Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, and his father's chronic illness, which impoverished his family to the point of pawning possessions for medical expenses. When Lu Xun was thirteen, his Beijing-based grandfather was wrongfully detained for seven years in a bribery scandal, an event that informed Lu Xun's disdain for the traditional governmental system.

In 1904, Lu Xun journeyed to Sendai, Japan, to pursue medical studies but soon concluded that China needed "spiritual medicine" more urgently. He returned to Tokyo in 1906 and committed to literature and education rather than medicine, signaling his lifelong commitment to the enlightenment and empowerment of the youth for China's revitalization.

Lu Xun's final story, "Divorce," appeared in 1925. The subsequent year, after condemning the killing of protesting students, Lu Xun was forced to flee. He relocated to Xiamen, then Guangzhou, and subsequently Shanghai, continually supporting leftist students. Until his death in 1936, Lu Xun advocated for political reform through direct activism and literary critique, authoring incisive essays against social injustice and political corruption. He fervently nurtured young writers, translators, and artists, and wholeheartedly endorsed woodblock prints that illustrated the Chinese people's severe trials to highlight the critical need for revolution.
