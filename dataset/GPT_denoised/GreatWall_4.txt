Great Wall of China

The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, amounting to more than 13,000 miles in length, situated in northern China. Recognized as the most famous symbol of China and its extensive, vibrant history, the Great Wall was first purposed by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century B.C. to prevent invasions from barbarian nomads. The most well-known and preserved section of the Great Wall was constructed from the 14th to 17th centuries A.D., during the Ming dynasty. Even though the Great Wall never effectively stopped invaders from entering China, it became a powerful emblem of the enduring strength of Chinese civilization.

Qin Dynasty Construction
Great Wall of China

The origin of the Great Wall of China dates back to the fifth century B.C., but many of the defenses included in the wall originate from even earlier, when China was fragmented into various kingdoms during the Warring States Period.

About 220 B.C., Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China under the Qin Dynasty, commanded that prior barriers between states be dismantled and various existing walls along the northern frontier be merged into a single system, extending over 10,000 li (about one-third of a mile each), to shield China from northern incursions.

The construction of the "Wan Li Chang Cheng," or the 10,000-Li-Long Wall, was one of history's most formidable construction endeavors. Directed by the well-known General Meng Tian, the project employed an immense workforce of soldiers, criminals, and commoners.

Consisting primarily of soil and stone, the wall stretched from the China Sea's Shanhaiguan port more than 3,000 miles west to Gansu province. In strategic places, sections of the wall were doubled for enhanced security, such as the Badaling area north of Beijing, restored in the Ming Dynasty.

With a base between 15 to 50 feet, the Great Wall rose approximately 15-30 feet high and was crowned with ramparts more than 12 feet tall, with guard towers strategically placed along its length. 

Did you know? When Emperor Qin Shi Huang began the construction of the Great Wall around 221 B.C., the workforce comprised mainly soldiers and convicts. It's estimated that up to 400,000 people died while building the wall, and many were entombed within it.

Great Wall of China Through the Centuries
With Qin Shi Huang's death and the subsequent fall of the Qin Dynasty, areas of the Great Wall were left in disrepair. Following the later collapse of the Han Dynasty, various frontier tribes assumed control of northern China. The Northern Wei Dynasty, one of the most dominant, mended and augmented the existing wall to fend off tribal assaults.

The Bei Qi kingdom (550–577) constructed or restored over 900 miles of the wall, and the efficient but ephemeral Sui Dynasty (581–618) repeatedly repaired and expanded the Great Wall.

With the rise of the Tang Dynasty after the decline of the Sui, the wall became less critical for defense, as China vanquished the Tujue tribe to the north and pushed its borders further than the wall's initial position.

During the Song Dynasty, facing threats from the Liao and Jin peoples to the north, the Chinese retreated, surrendering many districts along the Great Wall. The Yuan Dynasty (1206-1368), established by Genghis Khan, controlled all of China, plus territories in Asia and Europe.

To the Mongols of the Yuan Dynasty, the Great Wall was not a significant military bulwark, but garrisons maintained their posts to protect trade along the prosperous Silk Road.

Wall Building During the Ming Dynasty

The Great Wall as known today was majorly constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Early Ming rulers showed little interest in erecting border defenses, and construction was limited until the late 15th century. In 1421, Ming Emperor Yongle named Beijing, formerly the Mongol city of Dadu, as China's new capital. 

Under Ming control, Chinese culture saw great enhancements, with significant building projects that included not just the Great Wall but also bridges, temples, and pagodas.

Construction of the current version of the Wall started around 1474, with the Ming dynasty adopting a defensive approach and considering the renovation and expansion of the Great Wall crucial to this change in strategy.

The Ming Wall spanned from the Yalu River in Liaoning Province to the Taolai River's eastern bank in Gansu Province. It snaked from east to west through the regions of Liaoning, Hebei, Tianjin, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu.

Starting near Juyong Pass, the Wall was divided into the Inner and Outer Walls, called the southern and northern lines, respectively. Accompanied by strategic passes and gates, such as the Three Inner Passes—Juyong, Daoma, and Zijing— and the Three Outer Passes—Yanmen, Ningwu, and Piantou—these fortifications were critical for the defense of the capital.

Significance of the Great Wall of China
In the mid-17th century, the Manchus from central and southern Manchuria breached the Great Wall, advancing upon Beijing and ushering in the fall of the Ming Dynasty, replaced by the Qing Dynasty.

From the 18th to 20th centuries, the Great Wall became emblematic of China to the Western world, symbolizing not only the physical prowess of Chinese engineering but also the metaphorical barrier that the Chinese state maintained against foreign influences and to reinforce authority over its citizens.

Now, the Great Wall stands as a monument of human ingenuity. In 1987, UNESCO declared it a World Heritage site. Despite a common misconception that it is visible from space, which NASA has disproven, it remains an iconic symbol of China. 

Over time, roads have intersected the Wall in various locations, and parts have succumbed to decay after years of neglect. The most visited section—Badaling, about 43 miles (70 km) from Beijing—underwent reconstruction in the late 1950s and continues to draw thousands of tourists daily.
