Lu Xun, regarded as one of the greatest writers of 20th Century China, rose to prominence in the early 20th century through his incisive criticisms of traditional Chinese culture. Yet, another striking aspect of his work was his unique voice. Lu Xun did not only write in vernacular Chinese but also filled his work with common characters. "The issue of voice is central to Lu Xun’s thought," Eileen Cheng mentioned, while discussing her new translation of Lu Xun's work at a recent Fairbank Center event. "I aim to convey the voices that emerge through onomatopoeia and the lyrical quality of his writing."

The new translations of Wild Grass 野草 and Morning Blossoms Gathered at Dusk 朝花夕拾, which include twenty-three prose poems and a memoir of eight essays, join the works of the eminent translators Yang Xianyi and Gladys Yang. This husband-wife duo, who endured the Cultural Revolution's political persecution, first translated these works.

Cheng and four prominent scholars of Chinese literature convened to discuss this new translation, Lu Xun's influence, his historical significance, translation artistry, and world literature. Participants included David Damrosch (Harvard), Theodore Huters (UCLA), and Hu Ying (UC-Irvine), with moderation by David Der-wei Wang of Harvard.

Eileen J. Cheng: Surrendering to Other Voices

Eileen Cheng perceived a deliberate distance in Lu Xun's stories between the narrative "I" and the writer himself. In Wild Grass and Morning Blossoms, Lu Xun deliberately obscures himself, reflecting George Orwell's philosophy that effective prose requires the author's personality to be transparent. Lu Xun sought "new voices from alien lands," as Cheng said, and thus, Morning Blossoms extends beyond the author's biographical limits, capturing the essence of everyday life without specifying dates or places. This general approach captures a universal experience, including the mixed joys and societal pressures of childhood.

Similarly, Wild Grass gives life to unnamed, marginalized individuals such as animals, servants, and social outcasts. Lu Xun, by giving them voice and visibility, allows expression of sorrow and complaint. In the ending chapters of Morning Blossoms, Lu Xun writes sentimentally about Mr. Fujino, his teacher from Sendai Medical Academy. Authorial self-effacement, as David Damrosch commented, actually accentuates Lu Xun's presence within his work, letting readers acknowledge the diverse voices that animate his masterpieces.

David Damrosch: Global Influences and the Birth of Magazines

Professor David Damrosch initiated a lively debate regarding Lu Xun's position within world literature, proposing three aspects to understanding Lu Xun's voice: inspiration, affinities, and technologies.

Lu Xun was influenced by major figures in modern Western literature such as Jules Verne and Nikolai Gogol. His distinctive authorial voice had roots in his engagement with translation challenges.

Lu Xun's prose also shares similarities with the works of Western and Japanese contemporaries, akin to James Joyce's Ulysses (1920) and T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" (1922), showing the trend of authorial self-effacement in modernist writing.

Additionally, the surge in magazine popularity, a global trend in the early twentieth-century, enabled independent writers like Lu Xun to sustain themselves through regular short story publications. His work as an author and translator, and as a co-editor of the literary magazine New Youth (1915–1926) alongside scholar Hu Shi (1891–1962), was influenced by the era's print capitalism. Notably, New Youth published translations of Japanese and Western writers.

Hu Ying: Where does the Translator Stand?

Before becoming a celebrated author, Lu Xun was a prolific translator. Literary scholar Hu Ying delved into the translator-text relationship. She argued that translators are not equidistant from the source and target languages, citing the late-Qing 'translator' Lin Shu, who introduced much Western literature to Chinese readers without knowing any foreign languages—he depended on collaborators. Lin's intent was to create translations that were “smooth and pleasant-to-read,” thus leaning more toward the target Chinese audience than the source.

On the other hand, Hu Ying pointed out that Lu Xun’s translations demonstrate close allegiance to the original, allowing readers to view themselves through the perspectives of others. “Lu Xun faced the source material, but his heart faced his readers,” she stated. "And Eileen's closeness to the original in her translation is quite apparent."

Theodore Huters: Product of Cultural Crisis

Theodore Huters, a renowned Lu Xun scholar and Professor Emeritus of Chinese at UCLA, reflected on Lu Xun's thoughts on the “binary between China and the West,” which presents a historical conundrum. Lu Xun sought "new voices from alien lands" to rejuvenate his culture, while showing aversion to Confucian traditions. Despite criticizing the expressive potential of literary Chinese, Lu Xun continued to write poetry using classical standards. Professor Huters, who has studied this paradox for nearly five decades, notes that Lu Xun, reaching intellectual maturity between 1895 and 1915, was shaped by a prolonged cultural crisis.

The China-West relationship has been dichotomous since the mid-nineteenth century, with shifts in perceived strength. After China's defeat by Japan in 1895, the West began to seem superior, prompting a shift from "China versus the West" to "Old versus New." Against this backdrop, Lu Xun carved out his own path, though never completely shedding the period's ambivalence.

Lu Xun's multifaceted legacy challenges translators, faced with conveying the layered voices and cultural, intellectual, and historical nuances in Wild Grass and Morning Blossoms Gathered at Dusk. Furthermore, questions arise about how Buddhist and Christian undertones in his work should be interpreted, as noted in the webinar. Ultimately, Eileen Cheng's translation brings forth not just a voice from a foreign land, but also from a different era.
