Lu Xun (1881-1936) was a prominent figure in modern China as a man of letters, thinker, revolutionary, and the pioneer of modern Chinese literature. The evolution of modern Chinese fictional writing adopted influences from foreign literature and revised Chinese storytelling traditions, largely due to Lu Xun's efforts.

A Madman’s Diary, published in the progressive journal New Youth in May 1918, signaled the inception of a novel literary period. Rather than detailing the damage inflicted by feudal patriarchy and the madman's oppression, the story indirectly censures feudal ethics through the portrayal of the madman’s perspective and his chaotic expressions. It critiqued the inhumane ethics of feudal society with a starkly realistic tone and employed subtle symbolism, setting it apart as the earliest example of modern Chinese fiction.

Lu Xun's narratives are collected in two anthologies: Call to Arms and Wandering. Call to Arms consists of 14 pieces from 1918 to 1922, echoing the patriotic and revolutionary fervor of the May 4th Movement. Wandering includes 11 stories, such as The New Year Sacrifice and Soap from 1924, plus The Misanthrope and Divorce from 1925, reflecting Lu Xun's mid-1920s existential contemplation and continual quest for truth.

Kong Yiji is a critique of the imperial examination system, demonstrating its destructive impact on individuals through a succinct and direct narrative. Another notorious tale, Medicine, reveals the devastating effects of feudal superstitions on common folk and a young revolutionary's execution by feudal rulers. It is famous for the scene where Hua Laoshuan buys a steamed bun dipped in a martyr's blood, hoping to cure his son—a symbol of the need for enlightenment.

Lu Xun was profoundly concerned with peasant life, with many stories in Call to Arms and Wandering authentically portraying their post-1911 Revolution hardships. Storm captures the unchanged rural existence through a minor incident in boatman Qijin's family in Luxian County.

Hometown brings to light the dire reality of Chinese peasants in the 1920s, including childhood friend Runtu's plight, against a backdrop of starvation, overpopulation, taxation, conflict, brigands, corruption, and oppressive landlords. The narrative's empathy towards the subdued peasants has resonated with readers across generations.

The True Story of Ah Q, part of Call to Arms, stands as Lu Xun's defining work, set during the 1911 Revolution. It presents Ah Q's victimization, resistance, and eventual execution, highlighting rural class conflicts and criticizing the bourgeoisie's detachment from the masses. Lu Xun expresses both compassion and frustration towards Ah Q, aiming to awaken a revolutionary spirit in peasants. Internationally acclaimed, this novel is a monumental contribution to Chinese literature. Village Opera, among Lu Xun's other stories, is noteworthy for its adept depiction and commendation of peasant virtues.

Wandering also examines peasant women's fates, notably in The New Year Sacrifice's portrayal of Mrs. Xianglin and the uncompromising social commentary of Divorce. Additionally, In the Wine Shop, Soap, and The Misanthrope contemplate the lives of intellectuals. Old Tales Retold, drawing on ancient myths and historical narratives, expands the scope of Lu Xun's work, earning esteem from academics and folklorists. His fiction is characterized by its grounded realism.

Lu Xun revolutionized modern Chinese fiction by incorporating the adaptability and diversity of foreign literature’s structure, moving beyond the traditional Chinese chapter-exclusive format. His innovation cements his status as the father of modern Chinese fiction.
