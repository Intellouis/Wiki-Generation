Episode 19: Montezuma's Revenge

Introduction:

Amidst the diverse origins of homebrew games, some are commendable ports of erstwhile favorites, like Ultimate Frogger Champion by KHAN Games. On occasion, an ancient title is revived and adapted for contemporary platforms, under the watchful eye of its original creator, who ardently wishes to bring it to the NES - a vision enduring for generations.

Today, I offer an insider's glimpse into the NES adaptation of the Atari classic and pioneering Metroidvania, Montezuma's Revenge. Currently, development is nearing completion, headed by its creator, Robert Jaeger, through his firm Normal Distribution, with a Kickstarter launch slated for December 2021 via publisher Second Dimension. Consequently, today's post is a brief one, highlighted by interviews with the development team, aiming to pique your interest.

Game Evolution:

Montezuma's Revenge traces its roots to 1983, when a young Robert Jaeger, on his friend Mark Sunshine's suggestion, embarked on creating an Atari 800 game with a Mesoamerican motif. A labor of dedication saw the game premiering at the Consumer Electronics Show in the early '80s. Although the game initially demanded 48k of memory, Parker Brothers, to cut costs, compressed it into a lean 16k version, yielding an unwinnable boss encounter with Emperor Montezuma.

Gameplay Overview:

In Montezuma's Revenge, players navigate as Panama Joe (aka Pedro) through Montezuma II's intricate underground pyramid. The objective is to acquire jewels and vanquish adversaries, deftly maneuvering through traps and seeking the means to delve further into the perilous depths.
