Zhou Shuren, better known by his pen name Lu Xun since the early 1920s, is widely recognized as the father of modern Chinese literature. Renowned for his role as the nation's moral voice during his time, he initially became famous for his collection of short stories, which were characterized by their sometimes grim, sometimes humorous, and often satirical nature, and were written in modern Chinese vernacular. In addition to short stories, he penned poetry, prose, literary history, cultural criticism, and essays with a strong polemical vein. He revived his fame by becoming a master of the feuilleton, a literary form he used to first criticize the warlord government in Beijing in the late 1920s, and later in the 1930s, the Nationalist Party, which maintained a dictatorial governance after taking control from the warlords in 1927.

BIOGRAPHY
Zhou was the eldest of three surviving sons, born into a gentry family on 25 September 1881 in Shaoxing, a town located in today's Zhejiang province. Given the birth name Zhou Zhangshou and also known as Zhou Yucai, he was profoundly influenced by his literate mother and his alcoholic, opium-addicted father, from whom he would later take his pen surname, Lu. He received a classical Confucian education from an early age, which fostered his love for literature. He experienced family turmoil when his grandfather was falsely accused and arrested, leading to a difficult period where he and his siblings were forced into hidingâ€”experiences that would later inform his autobiographical works.

Lu Xun's disillusionment with traditional Chinese medicine, sparked by the illness and death of his father, led him to study science and Western medicine in Japan, where he developed an interest in literature as a means to inspire social change after witnessing the beheading of a Chinese spy. His subsequent return to China coincided with the arrangement of his marriage to Zhu An, which he dutifully accepted before returning to his studies abroad.

Throughout his life, Lu Xun grappled with the tension between Chinese tradition and the need for modern reform, a theme echoed in his literary and cultural criticism. Living in a time of historical upheaval, his work often reflected his criticism of societal issues and traditional mores. Despite attempts by various political factions to claim his legacy after his death, Lu Xun's staunch independence and skepticism of dogma in any form remained a hallmark of his intellectual stance.
