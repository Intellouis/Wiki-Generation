The Great Wall was built from the 3rd century BC to the 17th century AD along the northern border of China as a massive military defense project of successive Chinese empires, with a total length of over 20,000 kilometers. It starts at Shanhaiguan in Hebei province to the east and ends at Jiayuguan in Gansu province to the west. It comprises walls, horse tracks, watch towers, shelters, fortresses, and passes.

The Wall signifies the interactions of agricultural and nomadic civilizations in ancient China. It stands as evidence of the forward-thinking political strategies and strong military defense of ancient China's central empires. It is a prime example of their military architecture, technology, and art, representing a national symbol for the country's security.

Integrity

The complete Great Wall's route and elements from different periods are preserved, embodying the comprehensive defense system, including walls, fortresses, passes, and beacon towers, along with construction methods. The Wall's national and cultural significance to China is still acknowledged today, even though tourist facilities and a cable car have lessened the visual integrity of the Wall at Badaling.

Authenticity

The Wall's original location, material, form, technology, and structure have withstood time. Its layout and the integration with the landscape, representing the military principles, have been authentically preserved. However, the authenticity of the Wall's setting is threatened by inappropriate tourism facilities.

Protection and management requirements

The components of the Great Wall are protected under China's Law on the Protection of Cultural Relics and the specific Regulations on the Protection of the Great Wall. Conservation and management are ensured by a series of constantly updated Conservation Plans and oversight by national and provincial cultural heritage administrations. Guidelines are issued for local governments on preservation efforts.

An effective management system and specific conservation measures for the Wall's fabric and setting are being established. These will help create a sustainable balance between heritage protection and social, economic, and cultural development. Additionally, there will be an increased focus on studying and sharing the Outstanding Universal Value of the Wall to realize its social and cultural benefits sustainably.
