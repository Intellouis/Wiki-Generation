According to the modular theory of mind, our minds consist of multiple subpersonalities that vie for our attention. Learning about these can be unsettling but can also lead to increased autonomy. Science writer Robert Wright suggests that happiness involves choosing between the discomfort of recognizing your mental struggles and the discomfort of being governed by them.

We typically perceive consciousness as a singular, unified experience, although our minds and personalities exhibit multiple facets that can change over time. If we take Heraclitus's saying that "the only thing constant is change" to heart, we must question what aspect of ourselves persists over time.

This question of defining personal identity is intriguing and leads to numerous philosophical inquiries, similar to the ship of Theseus paradox or Derek Parfit's essay on personal identity. This article, however, presents a challenge to our sense of unity through the modular theory of mind, proposing that our single mind comprises various minds. Psychologist Douglas T. Kenrick states, "We are all multiple personalities, with several different selves inside our heads."

Our subpersonalities can be foolish, selfish, and sometimes malevolent. Often, we subconsciously surrender to their desires, but mindfulness and meditation allow us to become acquainted with our inner modules, leading to greater mental freedom by observing our inner selves rather than complying with them blindly.

Despite seeming counterintuitive, the modular theory of mind is scientifically grounded and verifiable through self-reflection. Adopting this model can enhance our ability to manage the relationship between thoughts and actions, even if we cannot control the thoughts themselves.

The concept that the mind consists of distinct functional modules dates back to the 1870s when scientists linked specific brain damages to particular speech impairments. For instance, injury to Broca's area affected speech production, while damage to Wernicke's area impaired comprehension.

The early theories that suggested the brain had clear-cut physical modules have been disproven. Although the brain localizes some functions, there is not an exact correspondence between brain areas and cognitive abilities.

Sigmund Freud theorized that the individual embodies an integrated set of subpersonalities, with our conscious awareness being just the tip of the iceberg, while Carl Jung divided the unconscious into personal and collective, with the latter containing universal archetypes. Although limited by their era's technology, which lacked empirical evidence, the theories of Freud and Jung provided substantial psychoanalytic insights.

Advancements continued with Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga's split-brain experiments in the 1960s and philosopher Jerry Fodor's concept of cognitive modules in the 1980s. Fodor emphasized that cognitive modules are innate, hardwired systems, specific to certain domains, and not assembled. Cognitive modules align with evolutionary psychology's framework of natural selection and adaptations. Accordingly, Douglas Kenrick views cognitive modules as domain-specific decision-rules that evolved to enhance fitness benefits.

Cognitive modules are not sharply defined but are rather an assortment of messy, interwoven subsystems formed due to evolution's opportunistic nature that utilized existing structures. This perspective aids in applying the modular theory of mind practically for self-improvement and introspection.

Meditation aligns well with evolutionary psychology and the modular theory of mind, as it involves gaining insight into the patterns and contents of consciousness. While altering these patterns may not be feasible for most, recognizing that we are not synonymous with them is attainable.

Robert Wright's book, "Why Buddhism is True," discusses the evolutionary purpose of mental modules and their activation by emotions in response to environmental stimuli. We may not be the masters of our minds, and our sense of control may be illusory.

Learning to detect the activation of specific emotional modules can guide our actions. For example, recognizing jealousy's influence on judgment in partnership contexts can prevent impulsive behavior based on biased perceptions.

The modular theory equates to having an array of subpersonalities, which we can become familiar with through practices like meditation — a process that the Tibetan word for meditation literally translates to. This familiarity lessens their control over us.

Medieval mapmakers labeled uncharted regions with "here there be dragons," representing the unknown, much like the serpent-like creatures depicted in myths. This aligns with Jung's concept of the collective unconscious. Similarly, meditation teacher Jack Kornfield uses dragon symbolism to describe the sudden, fear-triggered mental modules that can hijack our thoughts.

The practice of noting or naming in meditation involves observing and labeling these intrusive patterns, reducing their influence over us. We’re encouraged to acknowledge these mental modules and, even if action is warranted, to do so without being dominated by them.
