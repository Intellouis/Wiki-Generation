The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, totaling more than 20,000 kilometers (12,427 miles) in length, located in northern China. Originally conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century BCE as a means of preventing incursions from barbarian nomads, the Great Wall is one of the most extensive construction projects ever completed. 

History
The history of the walls that constitute the Great Wall of China extends back to the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE), but the Great Wall as we know it began its construction during the reign of the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, around 220 BCE. Subsequent dynasties, most notably the Han (202 BCE–220 CE) and the Ming (1368–1644), maintained and rebuilt the walls.

The wall stretches from Dandong in the east, to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. An archaeological survey found over 600 kilometers (373 miles) of the wall in Gansu province may vanish within 20 years, due to erosion from sandstorms.

Structure
The best-known and best-preserved sections of the Great Wall were built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). During this period, the Wall was reinforced with watchtowers and troop barracks, signaling capabilities were enhanced, and the construction process involved the use of bricks and mortar. The introduction of smoke signals, beacons, and the possibility of rapid troop movement improved the wall's utility as a defensive system.

Cultural Significance
The Great Wall is more than just a physical barrier against invasion; it has become a symbol of Chinese strength, resilience and engineering ability. It is frequently depicted in Chinese art and featured in Chinese literature. Its iconic status has made it one of the foremost tourist attraction in the world and a symbol of China’s rich history.

Preservation
The Great Wall is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, and due to its historical significance, efforts are ongoing to preserve the existing structure, although these have been hampered by both natural erosion and human damage. Many sections of the Wall are now in a dilapidated state or have vanished, but particular segments near Beijing and other tourist areas have been preserved and even extensively renovated.

In Popular Culture
The Wall has been the subject of many myths and legends, including the commonly held but erroneous belief that it is the only human-made structure visible from space. It is a popular claim in travel literature, although it is not true as the Great Wall can be hard to identify with the naked eye even from low Earth orbit.

Tourism
The Wall is one of China's biggest tourist attractions, drawing millions of visitors each year. Major restored sections near Beijing include Badaling, Jinshanling, and Mutianyu. Aside from being a magnet for tourism, the Wall continues to serve as a potent symbol of Chinese endurance and ingenuity.
