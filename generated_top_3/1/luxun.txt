**Overview**

The Great Wall of China is a historic fortification, which dates back over two millennia. It is among the most significant architectural feats of ancient China, representing a collective effort of various dynasties that have ruled China. With its broad stretch across northern borders of China and into southern Mongolia, the Great Wall's primary purpose was to protect Chinese states against invasions and raids from various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.

**Construction and History**

Initial segments of the Great Wall were constructed around the 7th century BCE by different Chinese states such as Chu, Qi, Zhongshan, Wei, and Zhao. These walls were built predominantly from regional materials like stone, wood, and earth. The most significant phase of the wall's construction began in approximately 220 BCE under Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who unified various sections into a single defense system. Subsequent dynasties expanded upon these fortifications, improving their scale and making use of local resources and innovative techniques to cater to changing defensive needs.

The most complete and preserved sections of the wall date back to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), recognized for elaborate defenses, including watchtowers and fortified passes. The Great Wall was not only a military barrier but also served to oversee trade along the Silk Road and control internal movements.

**Features**

The Great Wall winds up and down across deserts, grasslands, mountains, and plateaus, stretching approximately 5,500 miles (8,850 km) from east to west of China. The full length of all the wall's branches is estimated to be over 13,000 miles. The structure includes walls, trenches, towers, and other fortifications assorted along its length and with varying architectural styles that reflect the period and dynasty under which they were constructed.

**Cultural and Historical Significance**

Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, the Great Wall symbolizes the historical cultural legacy of China. It not only acts as a powerful emblem of the nation's enduring strength but also showcases the technical prowess of ancient Chinese engineering. Despite being built for defense, today it stands as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world, with estimations of over 10 million visitors each year.

**Preservation**

Throughout the centuries, both natural erosion and human damage have posed significant threats to the Great Wall's structure. Efforts for conservation and restoration have been ongoing, with varying degrees of success.

**Notable Misconceptions**

Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. It is, however, identifiable under certain conditions from lower Earth orbits.

**Visitation**

Located relatively near Beijing, the Great Wall is accessible and offers different experiences depending on the section visited. Badaling is the most popular and most restored, while more seasoned hikers may prefer the rugged terrains of Jinshanling or Simatai. The best times for visitation are generally considered to be during spring or autumn, avoiding major holidays for a more tranquil experience.

**Trivia**

The Great Wall has also attracted several prominent personalities over the years, including President Barack Obama and Queen Elizabeth II, who have stood upon its storied ramparts and looked out over the landscapes it crosses.
