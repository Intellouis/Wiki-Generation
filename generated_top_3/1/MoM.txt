**Overview:**  
The Great Wall of China, an iconic symbol of Chinese cultural strength and tenacity, is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It is regarded as one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history.

**Construction:**  
Originally conceived as independent walls for different states, it was unified into a single defense line by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, around 220 B.C.E. Successive dynasties expanded and maintained the Great Wall, with the most recognizable portions attributable to the Ming Dynasty.

**Length and Structure:**  
The most extensive and best-preserved section from the Ming era stretches about 5,500 miles (8,850 km). The overall length of all the wall's sections could be around 13,170 miles, including branches. It utilizes natural terrain features, such as rivers and mountain ridges, and artificial constructs for defense.

**Historical Significance:**  
Initially constructed to ward off invasions, the Great Wall also protected the Silk Road trade during the Han Dynasty. Over its more than two millennia history, it has symbolized the strategic and political dynamics of China, losing its military importance under the Qing Dynasty as the nation expanded.

**Preservation and Tourism:**  
Despite erosion and vandalism, parts of the Wall have been restored and continue to draw millions of tourists annually. Renowned sections include Badaling, Mutianyu, and Jinshanling. 

**Visibility from Space:**  
Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is not visible from space with the naked eye, though it can be photographed from orbit under certain conditions.
