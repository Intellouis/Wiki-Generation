Also Known As: Wan-li Changcheng ("10,000-Li Long Wall")
Category: Geography & Travel

Overview:
The Great Wall of China is a monumental fortification that was built over the successive reigns of Chinese emperors to safeguard their realms from nomadic tribes from the North. This vast structure, known as Wanli Changcheng in Chinese, which translates to "10,000-Li Long Wall," is one of the most recognized and enduring symbols of China's resilience and engineering prowess.

History:
Understanding the Great Wall's history requires tracing back to wall-building efforts that began as early as the 7th century BCE when individual states erected barriers to fend off their opponents during the Warring States Period. The most significant building phase was initiated by the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, around 220 BCE, when multiple defensive walls were unified into a singular defense system. Over the ensuing millennia, various dynasties modified, extended, and maintained the structure according to the era's military and political contexts.

Construction:
The Great Wall's sprawling architecture, encompassing multiple walls, some parallel, and others circular, is a testament to the dynasties that shaped it. Early walls were built using local materials such as rammed earth, wood, and stone. During the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), brick and quarried stone became prevalent construction materials, with soldiers, laborers, and prisoners contributing to the harsh labor.

Dimensions:
The wall stretches from Shanhaiguan in the east to Jiayuguan in the west, extending over 15 provinces. The Ming Dynasty's structure alone spans approximately 5,500 miles (8,850 kilometers), with the total length of all sections estimated to reach a colossal 13,170 miles (21,196 kilometers).

Significance:
Beyond its original defensive purpose, the Great Wall also offered protection for Silk Road trade routes and became an integral part of Chinese culture, imbuing a sense of national pride. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, recognizing its historical and architectural significance.

Tourism:
The Great Wall is a major tourist attraction, with over 10 million visitors annually, offering exploration of its various sections, each showcasing unique features. Popular sites include Badaling, Mutianyu, and more rugged areas like Simatai and Jinshanling, which attract serious hikers.

Conservation and Erosion:
While the Great Wall has stood the test of time, natural weathering and anthropogenic damage have led to erosion concerns. A third of the original construction no longer exists, prompting ongoing conservation efforts supported by laws like the 2006 Great Wall Protection Ordinance.

Visibility from Space:
Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall of China is not visible to the naked eye from space under normal conditions. However, optimal viewing from the International Space Station is possible and the structure is, at times, discernible in orbital photographs.

Notable Visitors:
Throughout its history, the Great Wall has played host to numerous global dignitaries and celebrities, accentuating its status as an enduring world wonder and an icon of human achievement.
