1. Introduction
Montezuma's Revenge is an iconic platform game, first released in 1983. It is recognized for its challenging gameplay and is considered a precursor to the Metroidvania genre. Named after the colloquial term for traveler's diarrhea experienced in Central and South America, it humorously hints at the game's difficult nature. The game was originally developed for the Atari 8-bit family by Robert Jaeger.

Critics and players have noted Montezuma's Revenge for its difficulty, often referencing it as part of the "FU Hard" category of video games from the 1980s. The game's hazards, requiring precise timing and spatial logic, contributed to this perception. Despite the challenges, it is praised for introducing elements such as its inventory system and level designs that encourage exploration, which would influence future games in the platforming genre.

Montezuma's Revenge's influence is evident in the development of the Metroidvania genre.
