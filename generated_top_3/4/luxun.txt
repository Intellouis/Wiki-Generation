**Luxun (Lu Xun)**
  
**1. Introduction**
Luxun, also known as Lu Xun, is the pen name of Zhou Shuren (Chinese: 周树人), one of the most celebrated and influential Chinese writers of the 20th century. Born on September 25, 1881, in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China, and deceased on October 19, 1936, Shanghai, Lu Xun is widely regarded as the father of modern Chinese literature and known for his sharp and incisive criticisms of traditional Chinese culture and his advocacy for social and political reforms.

**2. Biography**
Lu Xun was born into a scholarly family affected significantly by China’s socio-political turmoil. His classical Confucian education laid the foundation for his literary aspirations, but personal hardships and exposure to Western science and literature in Japan prompted a pivot from medicine to writing. Lu Xun’s literary career gained momentum after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, with his stories manifesting his concerns about China's future, reflecting his deep skepticism of traditional values and his strong martyrdom for social change.

**3. Detailed Explanations**
Lu Xun's works explored various forms of writing including essays, short stories, and literary criticism. His famous short story “The True Story of Ah Q” (阿Q正传) and his first significant short story "A Madman’s Diary" (狂人日记, 1918), were written in vernacular Chinese (baihua), becoming symbols for the New Culture and May Fourth Movements, calling for the use of a language closer to the spoken word. His role in the literary circle was expanded by his work in translation, bringing international thought into the sphere of Chinese literature and making him a proponent of global intellectual exchange.
