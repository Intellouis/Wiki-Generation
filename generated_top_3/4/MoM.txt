**Great Wall of China**

1. **Introduction**
The Great Wall of China is an extensive series of defense fortifications located in northern China and southern Mongolia. Known in Chinese as the "Wanli Changcheng" or "10,000-Li Long Wall," this ancient structure was built to protect the Chinese states against invasions and raids from various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. It is renowned as one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history.

2. **History**
The history of the Great Wall is a testament to China's enduring strength and strategic ingenuity. Individual walls were built by various states between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the most significant construction efforts occurring under the unifying force of Qin Shi Huang around 220 BCE. Subsequent dynasties, particularly the Han and Ming, fortified and extended the Wall to serve purposes ranging from military defense to trade route protection along the Silk Road. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, the Wall stands as a symbol of China's historical and cultural might.

3. **Detailed Explanations**
The Great Wall comprises several walls, some of which run parallel to each other, utilizing earth, stone, and wood based on regional availability. Notably, the Ming dynasty preferred brick construction, especially for fortifications and gateways. Over a million workers, including soldiers, peasants, prisoners, and animals, toiled, often fatally, to construct this massive edifice blending sophisticated ancient engineering with manual labor.

4. **Debates or Supporting Evidences**
Debate exists regarding the Wall's visibility from space, with the consensus being that the Wall is generally indistinguishable with the naked eye from low Earth orbit. Moreover, while portions of the Wall are well preserved, many sections have succumbed to natural erosion and human activity. Conservation efforts continue as this emblematic ancient structure confronts modern challenges.

5. **Broad Impact or Applications**
More than a historical relic, the Great Wall influences China's cultural identity and global tourism. It draws over 10 million visitors annually, symbolizes China's perseverance and complexity, and represents an icon of architectural and historical significance. The Wall has also been an area of research and interest regarding military history, engineering, and the cultural manifestation of barriers.
