Great Wall of China

**Definition:**

The Great Wall of China, also known as Wan-li Changcheng (万里长城, "10,000-Li Long Wall"), is a series of defensive structures that were built across the historical northern borders of China. It represents one of the world's largest military defense systems and has become an iconic symbol of Chinese civilization. The Great Wall spans over 20,000 kilometers (more than 13,000 miles), traversing a diverse and complex landscape while serving as a formidable barrier against the incursions of nomadic tribes.

**History and Construction:**

The conception of the Great Wall dates back to the Warring States Period (c. 481-221 BCE) when nascent walls were erected by individual states. The most extensive construction occurred under Emperor Qin Shi Huang in c. 220 B.C. when existing defensive fortifications were unified into a single defensive system. Subsequent dynasties, including the Han, Northern Wei, Sui, and especially the Ming, contributed to its expansion, renovation, and maintenance.

**Design and Structure:**

The Great Wall is not a consistent structure but a complex of walls, ditches, and natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges. The primary sections are made of various materials such as earth, stone, brick, wood, and other local resources, depending on the geography and era of construction. Features include watchtowers for surveillance, fortresses for troop lodging and weaponry storage, and signal towers for communication.

**Cultural and Historical Significance:**

The Wall epitomizes the interaction between the agricultural Chinese civilizations and the nomadic cultures to the north. It is an embodiment of China's strength and ingenuity, serving as both a psychological and physical barrier. While the Wall has been a symbol of isolation at times, it has also functioned as a means of protection for trade on the Silk Road.

**Contemporary Recognition:**

In 1987, UNESCO designated the Great Wall as a World Heritage Site, underlining its global significance and urging its preservation. In Chinese lore and literature, the Wall is often cited as a symbol of national pride and identity. Today, it serves as one of the most recognizable landmarks and draws millions of tourists from around the world.

**Geography:**

Extending across northern China, the Great Wall passes through 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. These include Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Liaoning, and Hebei, amongst others. The Ming-era Great Wall, the most intact section, stretches approximately 8,850 kilometers (5,500 miles) from the Yalu River in Liaoning Province to the Gobi Desert in Gansu Province.

**Conservation and Preservation:**

The integrity of the Great Wall is monitored and managed under strict protective laws, such as China's Law on the Protection of Cultural Relics and specific regulations for the Wall's safeguarding. Conservation efforts focus on maintaining the authenticity of the Wall's construction techniques, form, and integration with its natural surroundings, despite challenges posed by tourism and environmental degradation.

**Key Sections:**

Notable sections of the Great Wall include:
- Badaling: Restored and the most visited section, located near Beijing.

**Myths and Misconceptions:**
