Montezuma (c. 1466 – June 1520)
=================================

1. Introduction
Montezuma, also known as Moctezuma II, was the ninth ruler of Tenochtitlan, an Aztec Empire of what is now Mexico. Under Montezuma's rule, the Aztec Empire reached its zenith. He is most known for his encounter with the Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortés, and the tragic events that led to his capture, the downfall of his empire, and his eventual death.

2. History or Biography
Montezuma II was born circa 1466 into the ruling family of the Aztec empire. Ascending to the throne in 1502, he expanded the empire through military conquests and strategic alliances. He was both admired and feared for his leadership and considered a god-like figure by his people. However, his decision making became questionable as he dealt with the arrival of Spanish forces in 1519, leading to the loss of confidence among his subjects.

3. Detailed Explanations
Montezuma's rule is notable for his construction projects, including the expansion of the Templo Mayor, the religious and cultural heart of Tenochtitlan. His reign saw increased tribute demands and enforced labor due to militaristic expansion. Montezuma also placed a significant focus on religious rituals and the worship of the god Huitzilopochtli.

4. Debates or Supporting Evidences over this topic
Historians debate Montezuma’s reaction to Cortés and his men. Some sources portray him as indecisive and unwilling to take decisive action against the Spanish, which ultimately facilitated their conquest. Others suggest he was attempting to placate the Spanish with gifts and diplomacy. The exact truth is obscured by the historical narrative written largely by Spanish conquerors.

5. Broad Impact or Applications
Montezuma's reign and its demise signaled a pivotal change in the history of Mesoamerica. The fall of the Aztec Empire under his rule marked the beginning of Spanish colonization and the tragic end of a sophisticated indigenous civilization.
