Title: Montezuma

Introduction/Definition:
Montezuma refers to two significant Aztec emperors, Montezuma I and Montezuma II, who ruled the Aztec Empire during the 15th and early 16th centuries. They are renowned for their contributions to the expansion of the Aztec Empire, as well as their complex encounters with European explorers which ultimately led to significant changes in the history of the Americas.

Historical Context:
Montezuma I reigned from approximately 1440 to 1469, overseeing a period of military expansion and consolidation of power for the Aztec Empire, whilst significantly contributing to the development of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. Montezuma II ascended to the throne in 1502 and is notably remembered for his ill-fated interaction with the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, which resulted in the demise of the Aztec Empire.

Impact/Significance:
