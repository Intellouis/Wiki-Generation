The Great Wall of China at Badaling
The Great Wall of China is an extensive series of fortifications, generally constructed along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China. This monumental structure was built primarily to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids of various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls have been built since as early as the 7th century BC, with the most well-known sections constructed by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).

Description
The Great Wall, originally conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century BC as a means to prevent incursions from barbarian nomads, spans approximately 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles) in total. Its enduring status as an icon of both Chinese heritage and human perseverance has established the structure as a significant symbol of China's history and culture.

Construction History
The building of the Great Wall began under the rule of the First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, who unified various state walls in 220 BC into a single system of fortification. However, most of the existing wall was rebuilt, enhanced, and maintained during the Ming dynasty to guard against Mongol invasions.

Materials and Features
The wall was constructed using a range of materials, from earth and wood in its early stages to brick and stone later on. Segments utilize natural geographical advantages, such as steep mountains and rivers, to create barriers. Features include watch towers, shelters, and fortresses along the length of the wall.

Protection and Management
China has enacted the Law on the Protection of Cultural Relics to safeguard the components of the Great Wall, with conservation managed by cultural heritage administrations. Continuous efforts focus on balancing heritage preservation and the site's economic and social viability.
