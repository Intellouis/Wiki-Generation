Whale

Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. Whales are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order. They are known for their size, with the blue whale being the largest animal known to have ever existed. Whales collectively inhabit all the world's oceans and number in the thousands to millions.

Characteristics
Whales are fully aquatic creatures, which means that birth and mating occur in water. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though whales can reach the surface to breathe air, some species are capable of staying submerged for remarkably long periods. Whales have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

Whales breathe air into their lungs, exhale carbon dioxide, and have vertical tail fins called flukes for propelling themselves through water. They possess a dorsal fin for stability during swimming. Whales are known for their advanced communication skills and complex social behaviors.

Classification
Kingdom: Animalia
Phylum: Chordata
Class: Mammalia
Order: Cetartiodactyla
Infraorder: Cetacea

Parvorder:
- Mysticeti (baleen whales)
- Odontoceti (toothed whales)

Diet
Whales' diets vary considerably depending on the species and where they live. Some whales, like baleen whales, filter small fish or plankton from the water with bony plates called baleen. In contrast, toothed whales (e.g., the sperm whale) prey on fish, squid, or even larger prey such as seal.

Behavior and Communication
Whales are social creatures that often travel in groups known as pods. Their communication involves a variety of sounds, from clicks and whistles to complex songs. Humpback whales are particularly famous for their haunting vocalizations, which can be heard many miles away. Communication serves multiple purposes, including navigation, locating prey, and social interactions.

Conservation Status
Many whale species have been critically endangered due to factors such as hunting, environmental changes, and entanglement in fishing gear. International efforts, such as the International Whaling Commission, have been established to protect whales and manage whaling practices.

52 Hertz Whale
The 52 Hertz Whale is an individual whale of unspecified species, which vocalizes at a unique 52-hertz frequency, higher than that of blue whales or fin whales. Discovered by the US Navy's hydrophones in the late 20th century, it has been nicknamed the "world's loneliest whale" because its high-frequency calls are not recognized by other whales. Researchers are yet to physically observe this individual, and the speculation about its solitary existence has captured the public imagination, resulting in significant media attention and several cultural depictions.

Notable Aspects:
- Vocalization: Unusual frequency of 52 hertz.
- Cultural Impact: The subject of documentaries, music, and literature.
- Conservation Efforts: Ongoing studies to understand the effects of ocean noise on whale communication.
