Montezuma

This article is about the historical figure. For other uses, see Montezuma (disambiguation).

Composite body, painted, and glazed Terra cotta statuette of Montezuma II, dated 15th century, found in Tenochtitlan.

Montezuma, also spelled Moctezuma, refers to the title of two Aztec emperors of the Mexica empire. The most notable were Montezuma I, who reigned from 1440 to 1469, and his grandson Montezuma II, who ruled from 1502 until the Spanish conquest in 1520. The term 'Montezuma' has often become synonymous with the Aztec Empire's leadership and has taken on mythical dimensions within popular culture.

Etymology
The name Montezuma derives from the Classical Nahuatl language, combining ‘mocē’ meaning ‘young’ and ‘tezuma’ indicating ‘frowning’ or ‘angry lord’, thus yielding ‘Montezuma’ as ‘He who is lord and frowns like a lord,’ or ‘Young Angry Lord’.

Montezuma I
Montezuma I, also known as Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina, ascended to the Aztec throne in 1440 following the death of Itzcoatl. He was instrumental in expanding the Mexica hegemony across Mesoamerica, incorporating more territories into the empire through warfare and strategic alliances. Montezuma I is credited with solidifying the structures of the Aztec state and its capital, Tenochtitlan, and establishing the 'Flower Wars'—ritualistic battles that functioned to collect war captives for religious sacrifice.

Montezuma II
Montezuma II's reign began in 1502 and is marked by the expansion of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. However, his rule witnessed increased tension within the empire against a background of internal strife, tribute demands from conquered provinces, and omens predicting the empire's doom.

His reign came to an abrupt end with the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés in 1519. Initially believed by some to be the returning deity Quetzalcoatl, Cortés was received by Montezuma with honor. This encounter initiated a series of events that led to Montezuma's capture, the Massacre in the Great Temple, and the eventual fall of Tenochtitlan.

Legacy
Montezuma II's treatment at the hands of the Spaniards—whether he was murdered or died due to an attack by his people remains a topic of historical debate—marked the end of the Aztec empire and the beginning of Spanish rule in Mexico.

Both emperors are remembered for their military campaigns, public building projects, fostering of the arts, and religious devotion. Their legacies are intertwined with Aztec culture, and their lives and deaths have become emblematic of the resistance and collapse of indigenous empires in the face of European colonization.

In popular culture, Montezuma is commonly referenced in works relating to colonial encounters and has become a symbol of indigenous struggle, nobility, and tragic downfall. This symbolism has been perpetuated in literature, art, film, and even commercial products, though often with historical inaccuracies prioritizing dramatic narrative over factual representation.

Additionally, the phrase "Montezuma's revenge" is colloquially used in contemporary times to refer to gastrointestinal illnesses affecting travelers, historically stemming from the consumption of unfamiliar water and food, particularly in areas of Mexico and Central America.
