Fluency: 8/10
The passage overall reads fairly smoothly. The text flows well from one historical account to the next, presenting a narrative that is reasonably easy to follow. However, there's a bit of an abrupt shift in topics and periods which might disrupt the flow for some readers, as well as some repetition and awkward phrasing (e.g., "His observation was based on the fact that people on earth could see craters and canals on the moon, and so someone on the moon would be able to see something as long and massive as the Great Wall on earth.") which could have been smoothed out for better fluidity.

Understanding: 7/10
The passage contains a lot of detailed historical context which is informative, but may lead to confusion without prior knowledge of Chinese history. Complex sentences and the wealth of detailed information might require re-reading for clarity. Concepts such as the "Moon Fallacy" are introduced without much context, potentially confusing someone unfamiliar with the topic, although they are explained thereafter.

Structure: 8/10
The structure is clear and organized, with a logical progression from an introduction of the Great Wall, to its original construction, subsequent developments, and modern-day status. Sections are delineated by topic, making it easier to follow the progression of events. However, there are a few sections where the advertisement placeholder "REMOVE ADS ADVERTISEMENT" breaks the flow and could be confusing as it interrupts the text.

Overall Score: 7.7/10
The passage is thorough and informative, but could be improved in terms of fluency and ease of understanding for the average reader, particularly by smoothing out transitions and reducing the complexity of the information presented. The structural aspect is mostly strong despite the placeholders for advertisements, which should not typically be included in a final text.
