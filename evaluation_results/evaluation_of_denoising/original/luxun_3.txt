Based on the provided passage, here are the ratings for each aspect out of 10, along with brief explanations for the scores:

1. Fluency (9/10):
The passage is predominantly fluent and exhibits a smooth flow of ideas and facts. It maintains a formal tone and an academic style consistent with biographical and historical narratives. The choice of words and sentence structures are largely appropriate for the genre, contributing to the passage's readability. Occasional complex or lengthy sentences may hinder some readers but are generally manageable within this context. Please note that while the text is generally well presented, the score reflects a slight deduction for the few instances where the syntactical complexity affects the reading experience.

2. Understanding (8/10):
The passage provides a concise and comprehensive depiction of Lu Xun's life, work, and historical context. It successfully conveys a substantial amount of information while maintaining clarity. However, the level of detail and the numerous references to specific figures, literary works, and historical events might be overwhelming or obscure for some readers with little prior knowledge of Chinese literature or history. For those readers, this could require additional effort to fully comprehend, hence the score reflects this consideration.

3. Structure (9/10):
The structure of the passage is coherently organized with clear subsections that include an introduction, a biography, details of Lu Xun's literary career, politics, and legacy. However, the structure is slightly compromised by the dense packing of information within paragraphs, which may benefit from further subdivision for easier digestion. The narrative follows a logical progression but would be enhanced by more explicit transitions between topics and periods in Lu Xun's life.

Overall Score (8.5/10):
Overall, the passage is a well-composed and informative piece providing insight into Lu Xun, his life, and his influence. It is a dense text packed with detail but remains relatively accessible to the reader. The overall score acknowledges the piece's strengths while recognizing areas where minor improvements could enhance readability and understanding, particularly for readers less familiar with the subject matter.
