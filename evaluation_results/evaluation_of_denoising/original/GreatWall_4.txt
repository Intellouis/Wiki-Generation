Fluency: 9/10
The passage is largely fluent and easy to read with a narrative that flows well from one topic to the next. There is clear progression in explaining the history, development, and significance of the Great Wall of China. However, the inclusion of video player script-like text ("PausePause", "MuteMute", "Current Time0:00", "/ Duration Time2:29", "PlayPlay", "/ Duration Time3:37", "SETTINGSSettings", "Fullscreen") disrupts the fluency, as they are not part of the narrative and appear to be mistakenly inserted.

Understanding: 9/10
The passage presents information that is easy to understand, even for readers who may not be familiar with the topic. It uses simple language and provides explanations for non-common terms (such as "li"). The historical progression and thematic connections within the passage make the subject matter accessible.

Structure: 8/10
The overall structure is logical but could benefit from improved formatting. The passage is divided into sections with appropriate headings that guide the reader through the history of the Great Wall of China. Each paragraph maintains a focus on a specific topic or period, contributing to an organized presentation. However, the presence of the seemingly out-of-context video player instructions detracts from the structure's clarity.

Overall Score: 8.5/10
Although the passage is informative and written in an understandable and generally structured way, the inclusion of unrelated elements (video script elements) diminishes the overall reading experience. Without this issue, the passage would score higher as the content itself is well-presented and informative.
