Fluency: 8/10
The passage mostly reads smoothly and is coherent, allowing for easy following of the narrative about the "52 hertz whale." However, there is a minor issue with the consistency in the style of presentation. For instance, "fren" is informal and appears out of place compared to the rest of the text. Also, repeated phrases like 'Image credit: Igor Kruglikov/Shutterstock.com' impede flow and could be seen as a form of noise in the text since they interrupt the narrative without adding new information.

Understanding: 9/10
The passage does a good job of explaining the subject matter in a way that is comprehensible. Technical terms are clarified, and the historical context of the whale's discovery is laid out in a logical sequence, aiding understanding. Furthermore, the progression of the story—from its discovery to the recent developments and clarifications about the whale's conditions of living—is easy to follow.

Structure: 7/10
The passage's structure is functional with a clear organizational pattern: introduction of the topic, background information, discussion of recent speculation, and conclusion with current findings. However, unnecessary elements, such as the redundant image credits and the disorganized manner in which the author's name and position are presented, disrupt the structure. Moreover, the separation between the title and the main text could be better to avoid confusion. The blurred boundaries between sections of the text (such as article content, author credentials, and unrelated elements like the "DOWNLOAD PDF VERSION") could be clearer to maintain a strong organisational flow.

Overall Score: 8/10
The passage performs well in conveying the story of the "52 hertz whale," encouraging reader engagement through a smooth narrative and clear explanations. However, points are deducted for structural inconsistencies and the minor interruptions to fluency, such as informal language momentarily breaking the professional tone and repetitive credits disrupting the flow. With improvements to the structure and the elimination of noisy elements, the passage could achieve a higher score.
