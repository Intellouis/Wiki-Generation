1. Fluency: 9/10
The passage is largely fluent, with text that flows well and is free of significant noise or pollution. The narrative is engaging, and the use of direct quotes from researchers adds to the smooth progression of the story. There are places where the flow is slightly interrupted by ads, which likely were not intended to be part of the passage, indicated by "Report this ad." However, these interruptions are minor and do not significantly disrupt the overall fluency of the text.

2. Understanding: 8/10
The passage is quite informative and presents the subject matter in a manner that is relatively easy to understand. The content is clear for the most part, although there are some scientific terms and references that may require additional context or explanation for readers not familiar with marine biology or acoustic research. Also, the passage ends rather abruptly, which might leave some readers wanting more explanation or a conclusion, slightly impacting the ease of understanding.

3. Structure: 8/10
The structure of the passage is organized, and the information appears to be logically sequenced. It begins with a historical introduction, provides details and various perspectives from different researchers, and moves toward a discussion of the current research efforts and uncertainties. The transitions between different speakers and points of view are clear, and there is a good balance between narrative exposition and direct quotes. The existence of ad prompts, labeled within the passage as "Report this ad," is likely an error and disrupts the structure slightly. Additionally, a more definitive concluding paragraph could provide a stronger sense of closure.

Overall Score: 8.3/10
The passage is generally well-written, readable, and organized. There's room for slight improvement in the conclusiveness of the content and in ensuring that external elements like ad prompts do not interrupt the flow of the text. The curiosity-inspiring subject matter and effective narrative structure make the passage engaging and informative.
