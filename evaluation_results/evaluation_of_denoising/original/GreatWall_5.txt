1. Fluency: 9/10 - The passage is quite fluent. The information is presented in a conversational way, which reads smoothly for the most part. There is no apparent "noisy" or "polluted" text that disrupts the flow of reading.

2. Understanding: 9/10 - The passage is easy to understand. The facts are presented clearly, with good context to enhance comprehension. There are specific details and clear explanations that support the readers' understanding.

3. Structure: 8/10 - The structure of the passage is clear and organized overall. It follows a numerical listing format that breaks down information into digestible parts. However, without reading the full article, it's unclear how this list operates as a whole since we are only provided with selected items (e.g., 01 of 17, 02 of 17). The passage could also benefit from an introductory paragraph mentioning that this is a list, which would better prepare the reader for the format they are about to encounter.

Overall Score: 8.5/10 - The passage is well-written and informative with a clear structure, though minor improvements could be made to clarify the format and content expectations at the start.
