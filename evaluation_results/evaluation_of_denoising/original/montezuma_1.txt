Fluency: 7/10
The passage reads smoothly for the most part but has some minor issues that disrupt the flow. Specifically, the text contains a few awkwardly phrased sentences and transitions, and instances of repetitive or redundant wording. For example, mentioning that Montezuma's Revenge is a Metroidvania "before either of those two franchises were a thing" could have been expressed more succinctly. Also, game console designations such as "NSwitchDS_MontezumasRevenge8BitEdition_01" seem like placeholders or errors, which slightly interrupt the reading flow.

Understanding: 8/10
Overall, the passage effectively conveys information about the game's features, gameplay, and reviewer's perspective. The reviewer's opinions and descriptions of the game's mechanics are clear and understandable. However, the clarity could be further improved with better organization of the content, and by avoiding jargon that might be unfamiliar to readers not well-versed in gaming terminology.

Structure: 6/10
The review is divided into sections, which is a good structural approach, but the organization within each section could be better. Subsections are not always clearly delineated, and some paragraphs could benefit from clearer topic sentences. Also, random strings of text, such as "NSwitchDS_MontezumasRevenge8BitEdition_01", interrupt the structure and are never explained, which may cause confusion to the reader. There is also an abrupt change from assessing the game to concluding remarks without a smooth transition.

Overall Score: 7/10
In summation, the review gives a decent insight into the game and includes good detail on various aspects such as presentation, gameplay, and the reviewer's final thoughts. With some refinement in structure and increased conciseness, the readability and effectiveness of the review could be enhanced. Still, the information is valuable, mostly clear, and sufficiently fluently presented for a reader to understand the game's merits and drawbacks, as well as the reviewer's judgment.
