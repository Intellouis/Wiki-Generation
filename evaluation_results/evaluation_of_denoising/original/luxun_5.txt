Understanding: 8/10
The meaning is generally clear throughout the passage. The author provides succinct information about Lu Xun’s life, socio-political beliefs, and his impact on literature and China. Some sections may require background knowledge (e.g., May 4th Movement, the Communist Party’s view of Lu Xun) for full comprehension, but the passage is otherwise easy to follow.

Structure: 8/10
The passage is well-structured and follows a logical organization outlining Lu Xun’s early life, his beliefs, his influence, and his works. The content is split into sections with subheadings that guide the reader through the text effectively. However, the passage begins with phrases like "Portrait of Lu Xun Bettman / Getty Images" and "By Charles Custer Updated on August 13, 2019", which are not relevant to the main text and might initially confuse the reader regarding the structure.

Overall Score: 8.5/10

To improve, the passage could add context or explanation for certain historical references that may be unfamiliar to the average reader, and the irrelevant initial phrases could be edited for clarity.
