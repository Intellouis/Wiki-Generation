1. Fluency: 7/10
The passage flows relatively smoothly with well-constructed sentences and correct use of terminology. However, the complexity of the subject matter and the density of the text may impede fluency for readers not already familiar with the topic. While there's no "polluted text" in the sense of extraneous or irrelevant material, the academic style of writing limits its general readability.

2. Understanding: 6/10
The concepts discussed are inherently complex, and the passage assumes a level of background knowledge in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, which might not be universally accessible. While the passage is logical and each sentence is clear on its own, the cumulative effect of the dense information can be overwhelming and may hinder comprehension.

3. Structure: 8/10
The passage is well-structured, following a logical progression through the topic. It uses numbered headlines and subheadings to signal shifts in focus and tightly organizes the content under those headings. However, in some sections, transitions between ideas could be smoother, and there is occasionally a sense of abruptness as the text moves from one argument to another.

Overall score: 7/10
The passage scores well in terms of its structural organization and is relatively fluent, assuming a reader comfortable with academic and specialized texts. Comprehension for a general audience may be challenging due to the depth and complexity of the content, but for the target audience, this passage provides an in-depth exploration of the subject of modularity within cognitive science and relevant philosophical debates.
