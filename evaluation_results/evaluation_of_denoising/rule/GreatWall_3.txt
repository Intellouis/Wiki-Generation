Based on the aspects provided, here are the ratings for the passage:

1. Fluency: 8/10
The passage is, for the most part, fluently written with smooth transitions between sentences. There are a few repetitions of "The Great WallThe Great WallThe Great Wall..." which seems like a formatting or copy-paste error, contributing to a bit of textual noise. Except for this anomaly, the text is free from major disruptions.

2. Understanding: 9/10
The passage clearly presents the historical significance of the Great Wall, along with information on its construction, value, and the need for its protection and management. It employs technical terms related to heritage preservation, but these are typically within the expectation for such content, and the meaning comes across well.

3. Structure: 8/10
The passage is well-structured, with clearly defined sections, including a description, significance, and management practices. Although there is a clear organization, the structure could be slightly improved by better separating the sections (especially as reflected in the repetition of "The Great Wall") and potentially offering more explicit section headers for parts like "Integrity" and "Authenticity," which seem to blend into the "Brief synthesis."

Overall Score: 8.3/10
The passage performs well in conveying the message about the Great Wall's universal value, its preservation status, and the challenges it faces with modern development. The fluency is slightly impacted by the repetition error, and minor structural improvements could further enhance its readability. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive and informative piece.
