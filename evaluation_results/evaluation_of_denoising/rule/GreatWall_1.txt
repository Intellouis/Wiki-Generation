1. Fluency: 9/10
The passage reads smoothly for the most part, with sentences flowing into one another coherently and in an organized manner. There are occasional repetitions ("Great Wall of China" starts several paragraphs) and some terms are duplicated in close succession, which might slightly disrupt the reading flow. Nonetheless, there isn't any obvious 'noisy' or 'polluted' text present.

2. Understanding: 8/10
The passage is relatively easy to understand and the facts presented are clear. The use of complex sentences and historical details, while contributing to a comprehensive overview, could potentially make comprehension more challenging for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Technical terms and dynastic names are used without much explanation, which may require some background knowledge to fully grasp.

3. Structure: 8/10
The passage is well structured, with a clear organization following a chronological approach to discussing different historical periods and related construction phases of the Great Wall. The sections could be more distinct, with subheadings indicating various topics like "Early Building," "The Han through Yuan Dynasties," and "The Ming Dynasty to the Present." The passage sometimes shifts between different time periods without clear transitions, which may momentarily confuse readers.

Overall Score: 8.3/10
The passage serves as a dense, informative introduction to the Great Wall of China, with the exception that certain parts could benefit from clearer transitions and more context to aid understanding for those less familiar with Chinese history.
