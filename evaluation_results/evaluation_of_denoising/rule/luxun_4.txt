Fluency: 7/10
The passage is generally fluent, but there are some issues that affect readability. There are abrupt transitions, such as the sudden jump from "Introduction" to "Life" without a proper segue. Additionally, the mixture of bullet points and narrative text in the passage and the terminology ("Jump to:navigation, search") are more indicative of a webpage layout than a typical written passage, which can be disorienting in a plain text format.

Understanding: 8/10
The passage provides informative content about Lu Xun, allowing a reader to understand his life, work, and influence. However, some sections would benefit from additional context to aid comprehension, such as explaining specific historical or cultural references for readers who may not be familiar with Chinese history.

Structure: 7/10
The passage is structured with headings and subheadings, which gives an organized approach to presenting information about Lu Xun's life and works. However, the structure is somewhat compromised by the formatting issues mentioned earlier, and the text within each section could be better organized to offer a smoother narrative flow.

Overall Score: 7/10
The passage effectively conveys a lot of information about Lu Xun and is organized in a way that is logical, with subheadings that guide the reader through various aspects of his life and work. However, the issues with fluency and structure, such as formatting inconsistencies and awkward transitions, detract from the overall reading experience. With some refinement, the passage could be improved substantially.
