1. Fluency: 9/10
The passage reads smoothly and is well articulated. The language used is clear and accessible, and there is no noticeable polluted text or noise disturbing the flow of the reading. However, a small deduction is taken as the transition from Lu Xun's biography to his impact and works could have been slightly more fluid.

2. Understanding: 8/10
The passage is clear and the meaning is generally easy to understand, with information presented in a logical and straightforward manner. However, some readers might not be familiar with the historical context of Lu Xun's work or the significance of certain terms like "the Ah-Q spirit," therefore a brief explanation could enhance understanding. A slight deduction for the abrupt jump from the "Impact on the Communist Party" to "National and International Influence" which could confuse readers about the flow of events.

3. Structure: 7/10
While the passage has a title and headings that indicate a clear structure with logical sections, the passage itself could be better organized. The transition between sections is somewhat abrupt and there is no clear conclusion to the piece. Additionally, the details under each subheading vary in depth and some areas would benefit from more detailed connections between Lu Xun's biography and his works. The structure could be improved by including an introduction and a conclusion to frame the passage more effectively.

Overall Score: 8/10
The passage is well-written with few issues concerning fluency and readability. It presents information in a clear way, though some sections could offer deeper insights and smoother transitions. The organization has room for improvement to offer a rounded understanding of Lu Xunâ€™s legacy. Overall, it is a solid piece with minor areas that could enhance the reader's experience and the cohesion of the passage.
