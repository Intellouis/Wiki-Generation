1. Fluency: 9/10
The passage reads smoothly, with clear and sophisticated language that is appropriate for an academic or professional discourse. There is no apparent noisy or polluted text, and the overall narrative flows from one topic to the next cohesively. Technical terms and names are appropriately used and do not impede the reading experience.

2. Understanding: 8/10
The passage is generally easy to comprehend, especially for a reader familiar with academic discussions regarding literature and translation. However, the density of the names, references, and concepts might require a reader less familiar with these topics to pause and perhaps look up background information for a clearer understanding. Some sections assume knowledge about Lu Xun and the other academics mentioned.

3. Structure: 8/10
The passage has a clear structure, with each paragraph introducing perspectives from different scholars on related aspects of Lu Xun's work and its translation. The division of content is logical, describing overall insights, individual scholarly viewpoints, and reflecting on the implications of those viewpoints. The passage might benefit from a more explicit introductory sentence or paragraph setting up the context for the subsequent discussion in more detail, and a concluding section summarizing the main points or takeaways from the discussion would enhance the reader's comprehension and retention of the content.

Overall Score: 8.3/10
The overall quality of the passage is high, reflecting a well-composed piece of writing with minor areas for improvement in terms of immediate accessibility to all readers and providing a clearer framework for the discussion presented.
