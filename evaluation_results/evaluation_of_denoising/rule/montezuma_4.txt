1. Fluency: 7/10
The passage generally reads smoothly, but there are moments that disrupt the flow. Sporadic grammatical errors ("happended" instead of "happened," "must had had" instead of "must have had") and informal expressions ("ok I’m done now…") makes the passage feel less professionally written. Additionally, the walkthrough section seems more like personal commentary than a systematic guide.

2. Understanding: 7/10
Most of the passage is fairly easy to understand, with a clear description of the gameplay experience and the physical items associated with the game. But the transition between the sections is abrupt, particularly between sections such as "Gameplay" and "Game Score," leading to potential confusion. The passage lacks delineation between the author’s personal achievements and strategies, and a broader review of the game's features.

3. Structure: 6/10
While the passage provides several categories (such as coding, graphics, gameplay, and verdict), the overall structure is somewhat haphazard. The content within each category could be better organized, with clearer headings and subheadings (e.g., "Walkthrough," "Game Score, "Game Map," "Verdict") for improved navigation. The passage mixes objective information about the game's development with subjective gameplay experiences, reducing the clarity of its structure.

Overall Score: 7/10
The passage is informative and conveys the writer's enthusiasm for "Montezuma’s Revenge." It offers insights into both the game's technical details and personal gameplay experiences. However, the blending of factual information with personal commentary impacts its professional quality. To improve, the passage would benefit from editing for grammatical precision, smoother transitions between the different aspects of the review, and a clearer, more formal structure.
