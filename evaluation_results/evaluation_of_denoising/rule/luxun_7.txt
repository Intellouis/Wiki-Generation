1. Fluency: 7/10
The passage is generally fluent and easy to read. Some sentences could be improved for better flow, such as "Medicine is another famous short story exposing the life destroying feudal system," which could be rephrased for smoothness. Additionally, "Stormreflects" should have a space to correct the typo. Besides these minor issues, the text is not noisy or polluted.

2. Understanding: 8/10
The passage provides a clear summary of Lu Xun's work and his impact on Chinese literature. However, the reference to specific stories and literary quotations assumes some prior knowledge, which may not be accessible to all readers. Also, the phrase "by describing a small disturbance in the boatman Qijin’s family in Luxian County" is not entirely clear in illustrating the broader theme of never-changing rural life.

3. Structure: 8/10
The passage is well-structured, providing an introduction to Lu Xun’s themes and impact, followed by examples from his works, and finishing with his influence on the form of Chinese fiction. However, some of the transition between ideas could be smoother, and certain claims could be better substantiated with brief examples or analysis, enhancing the cohesiveness of the overall argument.

Overall Score: 7.5/10
The passage does a decent job in conveying an introduction to Lu Xun's fictional works, their thematic content, and his contribution to modern Chinese literature. However, small improvements in the flow of the text and clarity of examples, along with minor corrections, would elevate the quality of the passage.
