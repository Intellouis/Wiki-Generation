1. Fluency: 6/10
The passage overall reads fairly smoothly and the historical information appears to be accurate and well described. However, there are elements that disrupt the flow, such as the repeated phrases "Great Wall of China," "MuteMute," "PausePause," "Current Time0:00 / Duration Time2:29," and "Current Time0:00 / Duration Time3:37," as well as "SETTINGSSettings" and "Fullscreen." These seem to be misplaced video player commands or metadata that do not belong in a text passage and significantly impact the fluency. They are examples of "noisy" text and should be removed for a clean, readable narrative.

2. Understanding: 7/10
The passage is mostly easy to understand and delivers a clear meaning outlining the history and significance of the Great Wall of China. The asides that were likely intended to be video controls are confusing and out of context, momentarily detracting from comprehension. Removing these would improve understandability. Additionally, some background knowledge is assumed, such as the geographic locations and historical context; additional clarification could enhance comprehension for all readers.

3. Structure: 7/10
The passage has a recognizably chronological structure, discussing different dynasties' involvement with the Great Wall. It starts with its initial construction, moves through its history and various reconstructions, and ends with its current state and significance. The main issue with the structure is the reinforced error with the video control language that distracts from the overall organization. Without those errors, the structure would be more apparent and effective.

Overall Score: 6.5/10
The passage contains useful historical information and would likely score higher if not for the recurring errors related to video control text. If the passage intended to be pure text, removal of these artifacts would significantly improve fluency, understanding, and structure. The overall score is based on averaging the three aspects while considering the potential for improvement if the errors were corrected.
