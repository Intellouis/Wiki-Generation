1. Fluency: 8/10

The passage is generally quite fluently written, with sentences that read smoothly and text that is largely free from noise or pollution. However, without audio, it's impossible to evaluate text for "noise" in the traditional sense. 

2. Understanding: 9/10

The passage communicates the concept of RLHF quite effectively, providing a clear explanation of how it works, why it's significant, and the current state of the field. Technical terms are used appropriately and are explained in a way that should be accessible to a reader with some knowledge of the topic.

3. Structure: 7/10

The structure is logical, with the passage moving from a definition of RLHF, to an explanation of its importance, its applications, and finally to its limitations. However, the passage begins with a prompt that seems informal and lacks context ("Now Next Later AI"), which may confuse readers. Also, the final sentence seems out of place and reads like a promotional line, which somewhat disrupts the flow and objective nature of the text.

Overall Score: 8/10

The passage presents the topic of RLHF in a manner that most readers interested in AI should be able to follow and gain insight from. It addresses the technology's promise, current application, and the challenges it faces in a well-organized and generally fluent way. The minor structural issues and abrupt ending prevent it from achieving a higher score.
