**Fluency: 9/10**
The passage is well-written and reads quite smoothly, with no significant grammatical errors or noisy text.

**Understanding: 7/10**
The meaning is clear for the most part, but there are some references that might not be universally understood, such as the term "metroidvania" and the reference to "Orebody (pre-patch)" which assumes the reader has specific background knowledge on these topics.

**Structure: 8/10**
The organization of the passage is clear, with distinct sections for Story, Presentation, Gameplay, and Conclusion. This helps guide the reader through the assessment of the game systematically. However, there could be a little more cohesion between sections to seamlessly connect the reader's understanding from one part to the next.

**Overall Score: 8/10**
The review is detailed and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the game. It is clearly structured and fluent, though it could benefit from considering the broader audience when referencing specific gaming jargon or history. The conclusion ties the game's elements together well, despite the minor visibility of modern features mentioned as a setback for some players. Overall, it's an informative and well-executed review.
