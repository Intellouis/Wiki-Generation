Understanding: 9/10
The passage provides clear information in a manner that is easy to understand. Concepts are explained, and the chronological approach aids comprehension. The text delivers historical facts and the evolution of the Great Wall with enough detail that readers should follow the narrative without confusion.

Structure: 8/10
The passage is well structured with a good organization. It opens with a general overview, then separates the content into sections that detail different historical periods and particular aspects of the Great Wall. However, some sections have titles that are repeated (e.g., "Great Wall of China"), which may be a minor oversight in structure. Additionally, while the structure is logical, transitioning more explicitly from one period to another could further enhance clarity and flow.

Overall Score: 8.6/10
The passage is well written and informative, skillfully outlining the history of the Great Wall of China. It's engaging and accessible to readers, though minor improvements could be made to the section titling and transitions between historical periods.
