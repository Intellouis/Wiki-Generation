Fluency: 9/10
The passage reads smoothly with well-constructed sentences and accessible vocabulary. The flow of ideas is seamless and engaging, without any apparent “polluted” or noisy text. Nonetheless, a few possibly dense sections with multiple complex ideas presented in quick succession might slightly interrupt the flow for some readers. 

Understanding: 7/10
While the passage is generally understandable, it presents plenty of complex concepts that require some background knowledge in psychology and philosophy. Terms and theories such as "modular theory of mind," "cognitive modules," and references to theorists like Freud, Jung, and Fodor are introduced with some context but assume a degree of familiarity that not all readers may have.

Structure: 8/10
The passage has a clear organization that follows a logical progression from introducing the modular theory to discussing its historical development, empirical support, and implications for self-improvement. However, the structure could benefit from clearer transitions or subdivisions to help readers differentiate between historical context, empirical evidence, and practical applications more distinctly.

Overall Score: 8/10
The passage scores highly for fluency and structure, presenting a complex topic in a reader-friendly manner. Nonetheless, it doesn't score as high in understanding due to the presumption of prior knowledge and the high density of information which can be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter. Despite this, the passage makes a coherent argument and provides a succinct overview of the modular theory of mind with its practical relevance to self-improvement and meditation.
