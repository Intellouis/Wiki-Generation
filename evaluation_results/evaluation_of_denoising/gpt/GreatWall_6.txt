2. Understanding: 8/10
The passage is clear and presents information in a way that is easy to understand. However, some readers may be unfamiliar with historical terms such as "Xiongnu nomads" or might require additional context to fully grasp references to terms like "the Moon Fallacy."

The passage is well-structured, breaking down the information into sections dedicated to different eras or aspects of the Great Wall's history, including its original construction, the Ming Dynasty enhancements, the Liaoning Wall, and modern day preservation. Each section provides a clear and organized account of its topic, though a concluding paragraph that summarizes the key points would have further improved its structure.

Overall Score: 8.7/10
The passage provides a concise yet detailed overview of the Great Wall of China's history, construction, and preservation efforts. While it is generally well-structured and easy to understand, some minor improvements could be made to help readers better connect historical periods and to clarify certain facts.
