1. Fluency: 9/10
The passage reads quite smoothly, and it maintains a journalistic tone that's appropriate for an educational article. The text doesn't display any noticeable grammar errors, and the information flows logically from one point to the next. The consistent format of numbering the facts (01 of 17, 02 of 17, etc.) contributes to the fluency. However, since the entire passage of 17 facts is not given, there is a slight disjointedness if one is to consider fluency in the terms of a complete narrative or article.

2. Understanding: 9/10
The passage is easy to understand, with clear explanations of various aspects of the Great Wall of China, such as its history, architecture, and visiting tips. The use of simple language and the avoidance of overly technical terms make it accessible to a wide audience. The passage presents a mix of history, cultural significance, practical travel advice, and modern considerations (such as conservation efforts), all of which are explained in a straightforward manner.

3. Structure: 8/10
The structure of the passage is clear, with each fact set out as a separate item. This list-like layout makes it easy to follow and allows the reader to jump to sections of interest. Each fact is succinct and self-contained, contributing to a well-organized presentation of information. However, the full context for the listed facts (01 of 17 to 17 of 17) is missing, as we do not have the introductory or concluding elements of the full article, which may affect how the overall structure is perceived.

Overall Score: 8.5/10
The passage scores well in all three aspects, providing a comprehensive and accessible overview of vital information about the Great Wall of China. It is well-written and logically arranged, though the structure score is slightly lower due to the snippet nature of what's provided here, which may suggest a need for additional context. The overall score reflects the high quality of the passage with room for slight improvement in presenting a complete structural experience within the passage as it stands.
