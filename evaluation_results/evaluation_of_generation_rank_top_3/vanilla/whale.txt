1. Fluency: 9/10
The passage is written in a smooth and articulate manner. The information flows well and sentences transition naturally. There are no noticeable disruptive errors or 'polluted text' that hinder the reading experience.

2. Understanding: 8/10
The document is user-friendly and is written in a way that is generally easy to understand. It assumes a certain level of familiarity with biological and marine terms such as "baleen whales," "acoustic surveillance," and "taxonomic classification," which might be slightly challenging for readers with no background in marine biology. However, key concepts such as the whale's unique frequency call are explained in an accessible manner.

3. Structure: 9/10
The organization of the document is clear and well structured. It follows a logical progression from the background of the subject to the discovery, characteristics, and current status. Each section is properly titled and contains information pertinent to the header, which makes for an informative and coherent encyclopedia entry.

Overall Score: 8.7/10
The encyclopedia document is well-written, informative, and organized in a manner that makes it both educational and engaging to readers interested in marine biology, particularly in unique phenomena such as the 52 Hertz Whale. It provides an adequate level of detail to serve its purpose as an encyclopedia entry while maintaining interest through a narrative about the "loneliest whale." There's slight room for improvement in accessibility to those without scientific background, which would make the document even more user-friendly.
