**Fluency:** 9/10
The passage reads smoothly overall, with coherent sentences and proper use of language. It presents information in a way that is accessible but still maintains a professional tone befitting an encyclopedia entry. There is very little to no "polluted text" or noise that would detract from the readability.

**Understanding:** 8/10
The text conveys its meaning clearly and concisely, making it easy for users to grasp the topic. The information is presented in layman's terms without being overly simplistic, which helps in making the content user-friendly. However, the "Debates or Supporting Evidences" section briefly mentions debates and consensus without much detail, which might leave some readers wanting more explanation.

**Structure:** 8/10
The document is well-structured with a clear organization that is appropriate for an encyclopedia document. Sections are neatly divided and logically ordered, starting from the introduction and moving through history, detailed explanations, debates, broader impacts, and finally references. The "Debates or Supporting Evidences" section is slightly less developed than others, which slightly affects the overall structure and its uniformity.

**Overall Score:** 8.3/10
The document is well-written and serves as an informative and comprehensive overview of the Great Wall of China. It maintains a professional, encyclopedic tone, and the content is easy to follow. It has a clear structure that guides readers through the various aspects of the topic. There is room for slight improvement in providing more detail on debates and ensuring each section is uniformly comprehensive.
