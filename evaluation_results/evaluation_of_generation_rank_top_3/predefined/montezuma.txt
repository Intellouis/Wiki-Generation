Fluency: 9/10
The text is fluent and reads smoothly throughout the document. The use of language is appropriate for an encyclopedia entry, and there is a clear effort to explain terms and concepts in a way that is accessible to the reader. There is no apparent "polluted text" or awkward phrasing.

Understanding: 9/10
The document presents information in a manner that is easy to understand. It clearly states the subject of the article, offers historical context, detailed explanations, and expands on the broader impact of the game. The content is user-friendly, assuming some basic knowledge about video games.

Structure: 8/10
The structure of the document is logical, with a clear progression from a brief introduction to historical context, detailed explanations of gameplay, discussions about its reception and difficulty, and finally, its lasting impact. Each section is well-defined, though some sections such as "Debates or Supporting Evidences over this topic" and "Broad Impact or Applications" could be expanded upon for a more comprehensive understanding.

Overall score: 26/30

The encyclopedia document is close to an ideal format with high readability, understanding, and structure. There is room for a little more detailed content in certain sections to bolster the depth of information, which would make it a more exhaustive resource.
