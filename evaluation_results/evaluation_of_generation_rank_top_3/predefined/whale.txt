Fluency: 9/10
The document is very fluent and reads smoothly for the most part. The language is formal and fits the encyclopedic style, with technical terms used appropriately. There are no noticeable grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that hinders understanding. 

Understanding: 8/10
The text is relatively user-friendly with clear meaning, though the complexity of some of the concepts and specialized terminology might require some readers to have background knowledge or to look up terms. For instance, terms like "echolocation," "fecal plumes," and "cognitive abilities" are used correctly but may not be readily understood by all readers.

Structure: 9/10
The encyclopedia document is well structured and follows a clear organizational pattern. It starts with an introduction, proceeds to history and detailed explanations, discusses debates and supporting evidence, then talks about the broad impact, and ends with references. The structure is logical, with each section building on the information presented in the previous ones.

In terms of improvements, the "History or Biography" section could be more accurately labeled as "Evolutionary History" to better reflect the content discussed. Also, the "Debates or Supporting Evidences over this topic" section may benefit from a more pointed discussion of contrasting viewpoints or controversies to enhance the encyclopedia document's depth on debated matters.

Overall Score: 8.5/10
This document is a well-written, concise, and informative piece suitable for an encyclopedia, providing readers with a broad yet detailed overview of whales. The text might slightly increase in accessibility if it included some simplifications or additional explanations of the more complex scientific terms and concepts. Nonetheless, it represents the subject matter accurately and would be a valuable resource for those seeking information about whales.
