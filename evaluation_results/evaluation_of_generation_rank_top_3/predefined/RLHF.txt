**Fluency: 9/10**
The passage is highly fluent and readable, with minimal noise or polluted text. Sentences are coherent and connect well with each other to maintain a flow throughout the document. There is a clear narrative style that makes reading pleasant.

**Understanding: 9/10**
The document is user-friendly, with clear and accessible language. It avoids unnecessary jargon, making it easy for a broad audience to understand. The explanation of terms, such as "Wan-li Changcheng" including its translation, and the comprehensive but concise detailing of historical events contribute to good understanding.

**Structure: 8/10**
The document is well-structured overall, following a logical order: Introduction, History, Detailed Explanations, Debates, Broad Impact, and References. Headings are appropriate and content under each is relevant. However, the "Debates or Supporting Evidences over this topic" section might benefit from further subdivision to separate the debates from evidence, which would make it even clearer and more structured as an encyclopedia entry.

**Overall Score: 26/30**
The document is well-composed with a good structure, providing a neat summary of the Great Wall of China's aspects relevant to an encyclopedia entry. It is both informative for those unfamiliar with the topic and in-depth enough to be a useful reference for those seeking a basic understanding of the Great Wallâ€™s significance and history. The minor point deduction in structure is for potential improvement in the subdivision of content, although it is not significantly detracting from the overall quality of the document.
