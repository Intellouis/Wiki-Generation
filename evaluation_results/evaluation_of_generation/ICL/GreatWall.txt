The document is well organized, following a clear structure that would be fitting for an encyclopedia entry. It starts with an introduction, moves through a detailed description, construction history, materials and features, and ends with significance, protection measures, and recent developments. However, it could improve its structure by including subheadings for "Description," "Construction History," "Materials and Features," and "Significance," in order to better compartmentalize the information.

Overall Score: 26/30
Overall, this encyclopedia document is well-written and informative. It provides a comprehensive overview of the Great Wall of China, packed with historical context and relevant details. The integration of UNESCO criteria into the text adds depth, though these sections could be more tightly woven into the narrative. The "See also" section is appropriate and offers additional directions for interested readers. The document could further benefit from a clearer structure with defined sections but nonetheless offers a solid foundation for anyone seeking information on the Great Wall of China.
