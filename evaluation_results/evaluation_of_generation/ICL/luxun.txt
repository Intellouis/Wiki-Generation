Fluency: 10/10

The provided encyclopedia passage is exceptionally fluent, with clear and concise language. There is no evidence of polluted text or awkward phrasings. The writing style is formal, fitting the encyclopedic tone, yet maintains readability which makes it easily digestible for a wide audience.

Understanding: 9/10

The document is easily understandable with a clear meaning that is user-friendly. It successfully imparts important details about Lu Xun’s life, career, influence, and impact. However, for readers not familiar with the May Fourth Movement, "Ah Q spirit,” or some other specifics mentioned, some sentences may require external research for full comprehension.

Overall, the structure is suitable for an encyclopedia document. It begins with an introduction to Lu Xun, followed by sections on his early life and education, career and legacy, influence, translations, notable family members, and modern impact. Each section is organized logically. One slight improvement could be made by providing headings or subsections within the 'Career and Legacy' part to distinguish between his literary contributions and the description of specific works for enhanced navigability.

Overall Score: 28/30

The document scores remarkably well on all the evaluated aspects. It is well-written, informative, and structured in a user-friendly manner that adheres to the conventions of a quality encyclopedia entry. The only improvements would be minor clarifications and structure optimizations for enhanced comprehension and navigation.
