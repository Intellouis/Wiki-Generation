Fluency: 9/10
The document is written with high fluency, showcasing good sentence structure and word choice. The passage reads smoothly and is mostly free of noisy or polluted text. However, the term "usually excluding dolphins and porpoises" could potentially be confusing as it implies that dolphins and porpoises may sometimes be considered whales, which contradicts common taxonomy.

Understanding: 8/10
The passage is user-friendly with clear definitions and explanations of complex concepts such as the evolutionary background and the communication abilities of whales. However, the mention of "usually excluding dolphins and porpoises" without further explanation might leave some readers puzzled about the classification.

Structure: 9/10
The structure is appropriate for an encyclopedia document. The text is divided into logical sections with clear headings that guide the reader through the content in a meaningful sequence. There is a coherent flow from general characteristics of whales to specific details such as diet, behavior, communication, and conservation status. The final section on the 52 Hertz Whale adds an interesting facet to the document.

Overall Score: 8.7/10
The document performs well against the evaluation criteria, with a slight deduction for slight potential confusion in the classification and taxonomy aspect, which could hinder some readers' full understanding of the passage. The strengths in fluency and structure contribute to an overall high-quality encyclopedia entry.
