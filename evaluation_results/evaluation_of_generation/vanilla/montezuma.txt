**Understanding: 9/10**
The document presents information in a straightforward manner, making it easy to understand. The progression from a definition to an overview, followed by gameplay mechanics, development history, impact, and revival, allows the reader to easily follow the evolution and attributes of the game.

**Structure: 8/10**
The structure of the document is clear, with distinct and logical sections that build upon each other. Each section serves a specific purpose. However, the "References" section seems somewhat informal and does not conform entirely to proper citation formats typically seen in encyclopedia documents.

**Overall Score: 8.7/10**
The document is well-written and informative, with a small deduction for the structure of the references. It conveys comprehensive knowledge about Montezuma's Revenge in a format that is suitable for an encyclopedia, albeit with a slight deviation in citation style.
