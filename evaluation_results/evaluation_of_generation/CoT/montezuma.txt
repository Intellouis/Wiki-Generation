Fluency: 9/10
The document is well-written, with proper grammar and word choice that reflects the tone and style of an encyclopedia. It reads smoothly and is free of noisy or polluted text.

Understanding: 8/10
The text is user-friendly and provides clear explanations. However, someone unfamiliar with the broader historical context might need a bit more information on specific events (such as the "massacre at the Temple of Tenochtitlan") to fully understand all references.

Structure: 9/10
The document is clearly organized with a title, introduction, historical context, a main content body divided into sections for each Montezuma, an impact/significance section, legacy, and additional references and related topics. The structure logically flows from general information to specifics, then to implications and contemporary relevance.

Overall Score: 8.7/10
The article is of high quality, presenting information in a structured and fluent manner while generally ensuring reader understanding. It would benefit from a little more context for readers less familiar with the subject matter, but it is a strong encyclopedia entry overall.
