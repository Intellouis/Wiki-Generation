Understanding: 9/10
The passage is easily understandable and presents information in a clear and succinct manner. The meanings of sentences are direct, aiding user-friendliness.

Structure: 10/10
The structure is well-organized and appropriate for an encyclopedia document. The content is divided into logical sections, each with a specific focus that builds upon the information provided in the previous section. The subsections follow a natural progression from biographical details to broader discussions on legacy and influence. Moreover, the inclusion of a "Further Reading" and "References" section is commendable as it provides readers with avenues for additional research.

Overall Score: 9.7/10
This encyclopedia document is an excellent piece of work. Its high level of fluency and structure makes it a sterling example of an informative and accessible reference text. The slight deduction in the understanding category is to acknowledge that while the text is very clear, the political involvement section could provide a touch more context for complete clarity. Overall, the document is a well-crafted and valuable resource for readers interested in Lu Xun.
