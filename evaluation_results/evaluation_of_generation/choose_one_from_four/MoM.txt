Based on the outlined aspects of fluency, understanding, and structure, I would rank the four documents in the following order from best to worst:

1. **First Document: Modularity of Mind (MoM)**

   - Fluency: The document is fluently written, with technical terms appropriately used and properly explained.
   - Understanding: The complex subject matter is broken down into digestible subsections, making it easy to understand for the reader.
   - Structure: The document is well-structured with clear headings for definition, description, characteristics, types of modularity, evolution, applications, debates, and further readings, offering a comprehensive view of the topic.

2. **Fourth Document: Encyclopedia of Mind and Cognitive Science: MoM (Modularity of Mind)**

   - Fluency: The document is coherent and uses clear language, explaining the concepts effectively.
   - Understanding: Clear explanations and separation of points make the subject accessible to the reader.
   - Structure: Good overall structure with an introduction, historical context, detailed explanations, debates, broader impacts, and references, although slightly less detailed compared to the first document.

3. **Second Document: Great Wall of China**

   - Fluency: The passage is smooth and includes a rich historical narrative.
   - Understanding: It provides a clear overview of the topic, although some parts could benefit from additional context (e.g., specific functions of different segments of the Wall).
   - Structure: While the document has a logical flow, it's structured more like an outline than a complete passage with fully developed sections, ranking it slightly lower in terms of comprehensive structure.

4. **Third Document: MoM**

   - Fluency: This document is less detailed, and some redundancy is noticeable ("The modularity of mind" is repeated). It skews toward informality with less clear terminology use.
   - Understanding: The explanation is brief and might require more background knowledge to fully grasp the subject matter.
   - Structure: It has a weaker structure, with portions of the text reading more like notes or bullet points. Some sections, like 'External links' and 'Authority control databases', are mentioned without accompanying content.

Please note that all documents demonstrate a reasonable level of fluency and structure and tackle the subject matter with a clear understanding. The rankings are relative to each other based on the provided criteria.
