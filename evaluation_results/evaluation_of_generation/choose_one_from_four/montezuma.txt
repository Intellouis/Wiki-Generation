Certainly! After evaluating the four passages based on fluency, understanding, and structure, here’s how they rank:

1. Document 1 (Montezuma's Revenge (Video Game))
   - Fluency: The text is well-composed with smoothly flowing sentences.
   - Understanding: The information is clearly presented, allowing for easy comprehension of the subject matter.
   - Structure: The document is thoroughly structured, with distinct sections that guide the reader through various aspects of the game, such as its definition, overview, gameplay mechanics, development history, impact, and revival.

2. Document 4 (Montezuma (c. 1466 – June 1520))
   - Fluency: The narrative flows without any disruption, maintaining reader engagement.
   - Understanding: Each section provides clear and comprehensible information about Montezuma's life and reign.
   - Structure: It follows a logical structure, starting from an introduction, a historical or biographical section, detailed explanations, debates, broad impact, and neatly ending with references.

3. Document 2 (Montezuma)
   - Fluency: The passage reads well overall, though slightly less smooth than Documents 1 and 4.
   - Understanding: The document effectively communicates the historical significance of both Montezumas.
   - Structure: It is well-organized, using headings and subheadings to break up content into manageable parts, including historical context, main content, impact, legacy, and references.

4. Document 3 (Montezuma)
   - Fluency: While mostly fluid, the narrative transitions between topics are a bit less polished.
   - Understanding: It presents a decent understanding but includes some elements that might potentially confuse, such as the "See also" section typically found in online wiki articles.
   - Structure: The structure is not as cohesive as in the other documents. It combines a mix of history, cultural impact, and in-text references often found in wiki-style formats, which can be slightly less organized for traditional encyclopedia documentation.
   
The ranking reflects the relative effectiveness of each document in each of the specified metrics: fluency, understanding, and structure. Document 1 ranks highest due to its combination of readability, clear meaning, and strong organization, while Document 3, despite providing useful information, has a less formal and slightly disjointed structure compared with the others.
