To rank the documents based on fluency, understanding, and structure from best to worst:

1. **First Document**:
    - **Fluency**: The text is coherent and smooth, with no errors or awkward phrases.
    - **Understanding**: The information is well-explained and accessible to the reader.
    - **Structure**: Clear and comprehensive, with defined sections, headings, and key points that are well organized.

2. **Second Document**:
    - **Fluency**: The writing flows well, maintains clear language, and stays on topic, though slightly less seamless compared to the first document.
    - **Understanding**: Each section is informative and provides a clear message, making the document easy to understand.
    - **Structure**: The document follows a logical format with numbered sections and headings, guiding the reader through Lu Xun's details in an ordered way.

3. **Fourth Document**:
    - **Fluency**: This document reads smoothly overall, but the structure and presentation are less formal.
    - **Understanding**: The passages provide a good general understanding, but the details are not as rich as in the first and second documents.
    - **Structure**: There's a clear structure with numbered sections, although the contents are less comprehensive and expansive.

4. **Third Document**:
    - **Fluency**: While the text reads smoothly in most parts, it appears less formal and encyclopedic than the others.
    - **Understanding**: The meaning of the text is straightforward and easy to comprehend, but it provides less historical and cultural context compared to the others.
    - **Structure**: The structure is looser, and sections are not clearly defined as in the previous examples; furthermore, the inclusion of last edit information and licensing details at the end (akin to a real Wikipedia page) suggests it's a less edited and curated document.

The ranking was determined with consideration to how each document meets the criteria of fluency, understanding, and structure, with subtle distinctions that set them apart from one another.
