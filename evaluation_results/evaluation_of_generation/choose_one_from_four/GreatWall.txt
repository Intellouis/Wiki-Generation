Based on the criteria provided—fluency, understanding, and structure—I would rank the documents in the following order, from best to worst:

1. Document 1:
   - Fluency: This passage is written in clear, fluent language with no apparent errors or "noisy" distractions.
   - Understanding: It presents information in a readily understandable manner, with clear definitions, history, and contemporary relevance.
   - Structure: It follows a logical structure, creating a coherent overview of the Great Wall of China, including its history, significance, and conservation.

2. Document 2:
   - Fluency: The text is well-written and fluent, with few distractions.
   - Understanding: The passage is easy to understand, though it is slightly more dense and packed with information than Document 1.
   - Structure: The structure is well-organized, but it ends abruptly with references and external links, which might slightly interrupt the reader's flow.

3. Document 4:
   - Fluency: This document is fluent, with some debate aspects that might interrupt the flow for readers looking for mere facts.
   - Understanding: Complexity increases with debates and supporting evidence, which may require more effort to understand.
   - Structure: The numerical structure is clear, but it segregates the information into numbered sections rather than a continuous narrative, which can be less engaging.

4. Document 3:
   - Fluency: The fluency is compromised by requests for citations and the presence of a disambiguation note which could be distracting.
   - Understanding: The reader's understanding might be impeded by the essay's attention to needing verification and its embedded instructions for improvement.
   - Structure: The structure is disjointed due to the interjection of template messages, criteria listings, and casual references to needing additional citations, all of which disrupt the flow of information.

The first document excels in all three areas, providing information in a structured, clear, and fluent manner. The second document is also strong but is slightly less well-connected than the first. The fourth document, while clear and structured, introduces debate elements that might not be as straightforward. The third document is the least effective due to its less professional presentation and interrupted flow of information.
