**UNESCO World Heritage site since:** 1987

**Location:** Eastern Asia, particularly near Beijing, stretching across northern China and southern Mongolia.

**Overview:**
The Great Wall of China is an expansive fortification built over the course of two millennia, primarily to protect the northern borders of the Chinese Empire against various nomadic groups. The wall stands as one of humanity's most massive and enduring engineering projects, with the most complete and well-preserved sections dating from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). These stretches measure approximately 5,500 miles (8,850 km) from Mount Hu near Dandong in the east to Jiayu Pass in the west. Often following the natural terrain of hills and mountains, the wall also utilizes natural barriers to enforce its protective capabilities.

**Construction History:**
The construction history of the Great Wall dates back to individual walls built from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE by various Chinese states. Over direct conquest and expansion, separate sections were unified and expanded under the rule of Emperor Qin Shi Huang around 220 BCE. Subsequent dynasties fortified and lengthened the Great Wall to repel invasions from the north. The most significant construction occurred during the Ming dynasty, culminating in the structure recognized today, complete with watchtowers and extensive defensive features.
