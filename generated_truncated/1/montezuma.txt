**Dynasty:** Aztec Empire

**Death:** c. June 1520, Tenochtitlán

**Montezuma II**, the ninth ruler of Tenochtitlán, reigning from 1502 to 1520, was the last fully independent ruler of the Aztec Empire before the Spanish conquest. His posthumous name "Xocoyotzin" means "honored young one." Montezuma expanded the territory of the empire to its greatest size. However, his encounter with Spanish Conquistador Hernán Cortés and subsequent actions led to a dramatic change in the fate of the empire.

**Biography**

Montezuma II was born into the Mexica tribe of the Aztec Empire and took power in 1502. He was known to be a religious leader and a warrior who expanded the empire's reach through military conquests. Montezuma was also a builder who commissioned numerous temples, palaces, and works of public infrastructure.

The arrival of Hernán Cortés and his conquistadores in 1519 marked the beginning of the end for Montezuma's reign. Initially receiving the Spaniards cordially, Montezuma allowed them to enter the capital of Tenochtitlán, which led to his capture and became a puppet ruler under the Spanish. This period resulted in rebellions and unrest among the Aztec people.

**Death and Legacy**

There is debate regarding Montezuma's death. Some historical accounts suggest that he was stoned to death by his own people; others argue that the Spanish killed him. The fall of Tenochtitlán in 1521 effectively marked the end of the Aztec Empire.

Montezuma's legacy is complex. He is often criticized for his handling of the Spanish invasion but also lauded for his civil works and expansion of the empire. His rule and subsequent demise have been historical points of discussion regarding indigenous resistance to European colonization. Montezuma remains a significant figure in Mexican culture and history, emblematic of indigenous civilization prior to Spanish subjugation.
