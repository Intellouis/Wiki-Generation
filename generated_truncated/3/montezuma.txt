Moctezuma I, also known as Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina, was the fifth Aztec emperor who ruled from 1440 to 1469, known for his conquests and the expansion of the Aztec Empire.

Moctezuma II, also known as Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin, was the ninth Aztec emperor, ascending to the throne in 1502. He was the leader during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, led by Hernán Cortés, and is notable for his interaction with the Spaniards, which eventually led to his demise and the fall of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán in 1521.

Etymology
The name "Moctezuma" comes from the Classical Nahuatl language, meaning "he is the angry lord" or "he frowns like a lord", from moc(tli), "molar", teuc(tli), "lord", and zoma, "frown, be angry".[1]

Biography
Moctezuma I is known for his contribution to the construction of the Templo Mayor, a large temple in the capital Tenochtitlán and various public works. He also implemented significant social and governmental reforms.

Moctezuma II's reign is marked by the arrival of Europeans in present-day Mexico. His initial approach was to maintain diplomacy with the Spaniards, offering them gifts, which might have been misinterpreted as a sign of submission, strengthening the resolve of the invaders.

Legacy
Montezuma's legacy is complex, as it represents both the apex and the downfall of the Aztec Empire. His figure is seen differently across cultures: in Mexico, he is often associated with resistance against colonialism, whereas in European perspectives, he is sometimes depicted as exotic or submissive.

In Popular Culture
The inspiration drawn from these historical figures translates into various aspects of popular culture. One prominent example is the video game Montezuma's Revenge, a pioneering platform game initially released for the Atari 800 in 1983 that gained popularity on many systems of that era.

In the game, players control Panama Joe (originally referred to as Pedro in early versions), navigating a series of labyrinthine temples filled with traps and treasures, a homage to the legend of Montezuma and his rumored hidden wealth.
