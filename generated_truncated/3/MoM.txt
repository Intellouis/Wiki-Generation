The term MoM refers to an informal measurement unit occasionally used in discussions about the Great Wall of China (Chinese: 长城; pinyin: Chángchéng), symbolizing the immense length of the structure. MoM stands for "Measure of Magnitude" in discussions concerning the Great Wall and is not a recognized standard unit of measurement.

Great Wall of China

Also known as: Wan-li Changcheng
Category: Geography & Travel
Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, the Great Wall of China represents a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. It was built along the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.

Dimensions and Scope

The Great Wall extends from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. Archaeological surveys have identified remnants of the wall that collectively stretch much farther than initially thought, covering over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 mi). 

History

Construction on the Great Wall started as early as the 7th century BC, with several walls being built and later joined together. The most well-known sections were made by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is not a single wall but a network of various walls and fortifications.

Visibility from Space

The often-quoted claim that the Great Wall can be seen from space with the naked eye is not accurate. Due to its coloration blending with the natural landscape, it is indistinguishable from an orbiting distance.

Cultural Significance

As a powerful symbol of China's enduring strength and resilience, the Great Wall is a poignant reminder of the historical volatility experienced by the region. Its vastness, complexity, and the sheer human endeavor to construct and maintain it have made the Great Wall a national emblem and a universal example of architectural triumph and endurance.

Preservation Efforts

Over the centuries, various parts of the Great Wall have been eroded or damaged. Currently, preservation and restoration efforts are ongoing, though challenges remain due to the wall's length and the varied terrains it crosses.
