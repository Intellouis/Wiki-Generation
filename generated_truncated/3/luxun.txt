Lu Xun

This article is about the Chinese writer. For other uses, see Lu Xun (disambiguation).

Lu Xun (Traditional Chinese: 魯迅; Simplified Chinese: 鲁迅; pinyin: Lǔ Xùn; Wade-Giles: Lu Hsün), born Zhou Shuren on September 25, 1881, and died on October 19, 1936, was a significant figure in modern Chinese literature. His substantial influence stems from his short stories, essays, and translations that critiqued and reflected on Chinese society, traditional values, and the cultural shifts during the early 20th century. Zhou Shuren adopted the pen name "Lu Xun" from the 1920s and has since been celebrated for his pioneering contribution to baihua literature, which utilizes the Chinese vernacular.

Early Life and Education
Lu Xun was born into a prestigious but declining scholarly family in Shaoxing, Zhejiang province. His classical Confucian education laid the foundation for his deep engagement with literature. The early death of his father, due to illness, fueled Lu Xun's initial pursuit of a medical education in Japan, reflecting his hope to help heal his countrymen. However, an incident where he witnessed the execution of a captured Chinese spy catalyzed his shift from medicine to literature—believing that mental emancipation was more crucial for China’s revival.

Literary Career
Lu Xun’s literary career commenced in Japan, where he wrote essays on literature and natural sciences and translated works to inspire patriotism among his countrymen. He returned to China to become an esteemed educator, instructing at several institutions and later becoming the principal at Shaoxing Middle School. Disillusionment with the Chinese Republic's inefficiency and corruption led him to embrace Marxist and Leninist ideologies after Russia's October Revolution in 1917.

In 1918, Lu Xun published his first significant baihua work, "A Madman's Diary" (狂人日記), which allegorically criticized traditional Confucian culture. His collection "Call to Arms" (呐喊), including the noted story "The True Story of Ah Q" (阿Q正傳), vividly portrayed the struggles of ordinary Chinese citizens, energizing the literary arena with a clear, piercing voice advocating social change.

Later Life and Work
Lu Xun's later works include "Wandering" (彷徨), which consists of stories that explore individual predicaments amidst a socio-political upheaval. As a co-founder of the League of Left-Wing Writers, he played a crucial role in promoting progressive ideas through literature. Despite often facing censorship and government scrutiny, he never ceased to address subjects like national identity, cultural heritage, and the individual’s role in social progress.

Translation and Legacy
Lu Xun's influence extended into the field of translation, introducing foreign classics to Chinese audiences and thereby enriching the cross-cultural dialogue. His translations and essays demonstrated scholarly acuity and contributed to broader conversations within world literature. Despite political turbulence, including during the Cultural Revolution, his work remained influential, and recent translations continue to draw attention to the nuances of his craft and thought.

Lu Xun is revered as an emblematic intellectual who used the power of the written word to challenge and reflect his era's social realities. His narratives’ complexity, carved through characters encompassing the Chinese populace, established him as the moral voice of a nation struggling to find its modern identity. Mao Zedong posthumously praised Lu Xun as the "saint of modern China," underscoring his indelible mark on Chinese culture and literature.

Death and Posthumous Recognition
Lu Xun passed away on October 19, 1936, in Shanghai, leaving behind a legacy that has prompted numerous studies and translations of his work. He is memorialized in China through museums, literary awards, and commemorations. UNESCO recognized his contributions to world literature on the 50th anniversary of his death in 1986, and his writings remain standard readings in Chinese educational curriculums.
