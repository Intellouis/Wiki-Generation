The Great Wall of China at Jinshanling

The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups from Eurasia. The most comprehensive and best-preserved section of the wall dates from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and runs for 5,500 miles (8,850 km) from Hushan to the Jiayuguan Pass.

Also known as: Wan-li Changcheng

Chinese (Pinyin): Wanli Changcheng

Designation: UNESCO World Heritage site (1987)

Location: Eastern Asia, primarily in northern China, extending across 15 provinces.

History

The earliest walls date back to the 7th to 4th centuries B.C. during the Warring States period. The most famous parts of the wall were built by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, around 220 B.C.E, though earlier constructions existed. Little of that earliest wall remains as subsequent dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The purpose of the constructions was to defend against nomadic invasions from the north. The best-known and best-preserved sections of the Great Wall were constructed during the Ming dynasty.

Structure
The Great Wall follows the ridge lines of mountains and utilizes natural barriers like rivers and mountain passes to enhance its defensive capabilities. The wall incorporates fortresses, watchtowers for communication, garrison stations, and signal towers for defense against invaders. Despite common misconceptions, the wall could not be seen from space without aid.

Length
Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the entire Great Wall, with all of its branches, stretches over a massive 13,170 miles. Without its branches, the Ming dynasty stretch is approximately 5,500 miles.

Visibility from Space
Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall is not visible from space with the naked eye. Earth's natural landscapes obscure it from orbit.

Significance
As an iconic symbol of Chinese history and culture, the Great Wall is not only a grand construction but also a representation of the sophisticated military thinking of ancient Chinese civilization. It embodies the Chinese spirits of perseverance and endurance. Over the centuries, the wall has become a repository of history, embodying the rise and fall of dynasties, wars, and the exchange of cultural and economic practices along the Silk Road.

Tourism
The Great Wall is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Notable sections such as Badaling, Mutianyu, Simatai, and Jinshanling offer visitors different insights – from the most popular and restored to those that represent the original ruggedness.

Conservation
Owing to its historical importance and symbolic significance, conservation efforts are crucial to preserving the Great Wall. Restoration work takes place regularly, but challenges arise due to natural erosion, human damage, and the sheer scale of the structure.
