Great Wall of China

1. Introduction
The Great Wall of China, also known as Wan-li Changcheng, which translates to the "10,000-Li Long Wall," is an expansive fortification system that has come to symbolize China both physically and metaphorically. Recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in human history, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 due to its historical significance and scale.

2. History
The history of the Great Wall dates back to as early as the 7th century BCE, when several individual walls were constructed by various Chinese states during the Warring States period. The most well-known and preserved sections of the Wall were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368â€“1644) as a defense mechanism against invasions from the North. Emperors across different Chinese dynasties have contributed to the fortification's construction, extending and fortifying it based on the needs of their respective eras.

3. Detailed Explanations
The total length of the Wall, including all of its branches, measures approximately 13,170 miles (21,196 km). Its design and construction vary depending on the topography, with some sections featuring natural barriers such as rivers. Materials used in construction have varied over different periods, from rammed earth to bricks and stone. The most celebrated segment of the Ming Great Wall stretches around 5,500 miles (8,850 km) from Hushan to Jiayuguan Pass.

4. Debates or Supporting Evidences
A common myth is that the Great Wall is visible from space with the naked eye. This belief has been debunked, as the structure is difficult to discern from low Earth orbit due to its colors often blending with the natural landscape. Nonetheless, satellite technology has allowed for more accurate surveys and mapping, confirming the Wall's extensive reach across northern China.

5. Broad Impact or Applications
Beyond its original military purpose, the Great Wall has acquired a multitude of meanings. It is emblematic of Chinese cultural persistence and hosts millions of tourists each year. Sections like Badaling and Mutianyu are especially popular with visitors due to their accessibility and state of preservation. Moreover, the Wall serves as a potent symbol in literature and media, representing the breadth of Chinese civilization and its historical depth.
