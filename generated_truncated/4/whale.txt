Whale
Introduction
Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises all belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. Whales are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They are known for their large size, with the blue whale being the largest animal known to have ever existed. Whales vary widely in biology, lifestyle, and habitat preferences, ranging from the tiny 2.6 meters (8.5 feet) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the aforementioned blue whale, which can reach lengths of 29.9 meters (98 feet) and weigh 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short tons).

History or Biography
The history of whales traces back to early artiodactyl land ancestors before the group evolved to fully aquatic creatures. Through a series of evolutionary transformations, whales adapted to life in the water. The transition from land to sea began around 50 million years ago during the Eocene epoch. Fossil records indicate that early precursors to whales, such as Pakicetus, gradually adapted to a marine lifestyle, developing specialized features for an aquatic environment including tail flukes and the loss of hind limbs. Over time, distinct lineages of whales emerged, including baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti).

Detailed Explanations
Whales are divided into two suborders: Mysticeti (baleen whales), which use baleen plates in their mouths to filter-feed on small aquatic life, and Odontoceti (toothed whales), which have teeth and prey on fish, squid, and other marine mammals. Mysticeti includes species like the blue whale, humpback whale, and gray whale. Odontoceti includes dolphins, porpoises, and others like the sperm whale. Whales have several adaptations for aquatic life, including a streamlined body to reduce drag in water, a thick layer of blubber for insulation, and modified limbs shaped into flippers for swimming.

Debates or Supporting Evidences over this topic
There have been debates about whale conservation, the impact of human activities on whale populations, and the ethical implications of whaling. Various international laws, agreements, and organizations focus on the protection of whale species, including the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which regulates whaling activities. Scientists continue to study whale behavior, communication, and biology to contribute to their conservation.

Broad Impact or Applications
Whales play a significant role in the health of marine ecosystems. They contribute to the nutrient cycle by releasing fecal plumes which are rich in nutrients and, upon death, their bodies fall to the seafloor and provide a substantial habitat called a whale fall. Whale watching has become an important part of coastal tourism, providing economic benefits to many communities.
