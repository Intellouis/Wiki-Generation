**1. Definition:**
The Great Wall of China, also known in Chinese as the Wan-li Changcheng, meaning "10,000-Li Long Wall," is an extensive network of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, and other materials.

**2. Characteristics and Dimensions:**
Historically built to protect the Chinese states against various nomadic groups, the Great Wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, covering diverse landscapes. The most well-preserved sections date from the Ming Dynasty and stretch over 5,500 miles. The wall's dimensions vary, with its height ranging from 15 to 39 feet and its largest width at 32 feet.

**3. Construction History:**
Construction of the wall started as early as the 7th century BCE, with contributions from several Chinese dynasties, but most notably, the first unified construction was under Qin Shi Huang around 220 BCE. This ongoing project culminated in significant advancements during the Ming Dynasty from 1368 to 1644.

**4. Archaeological Findings:**
Research and explorations in the 1990s led to discoveries of previously unknown sections in Liaoning Province, significantly expanding the recognized length of the wall and contributing to updated measurements of its total length.
