**Title**: Great Wall of China

**Introduction**: The Great Wall of China, known in Chinese as Wanli Changcheng, is an ancient series of walls and fortifications located in northern China. Originally built to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of various nomadic groups, it now stands as a globally recognized symbol of China's historical strength and architectural grandeur.

**Background**:
- Origin and Name: Referred to as the "10,000-Li Long Wall" in Chinese, this expansive construction is a testament to China's historical defensive strategies.
- Geographic Span: Set in eastern Asia, it stretches across 15 provinces, from the sea at Shanhaiguan in Hebei province to the desert at Jiayuguan in Gansu province.
- UNESCO Status: It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 for its cultural and historical significance.

**Construction**:
- Early Wall: Its construction history dates back to individual walls built by Chinese states between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE.
- Unified Great Wall: The unification of these walls into a single, albeit discontinuous structure, began during the Qin dynasty around 220 BCE.
- Material and Structure: Constructed from a variety of materials including earth, brick, wood, stone, and other materials; it facilitated defense with watchtowers, troop barracks, and garrison stations.
- Ming Dynasty Enhancements: The best-preserved section is attributed to the Ming Dynasty, who fortified and extended the wall in response to Mongol invasions.

**Dimensions**:
- Total Length: The combined length of all of its sections is believed to be around 13,170 miles, with the Ming-dynasty stretch accounting for roughly 5,500 miles.
- Height and Width: The wall's height varies from 15 to 39 feet, while its thickness can reach up to 32 feet at certain points.

**Significance and Misconceptions**:
- Cultural Icon: The wall represents an enduring symbol of Chinese resilience and engineering prowess.
- Visibility from Space: Despite common beliefs, it is not visible from space with the naked eye due to its materials and colors blending with the natural environment.

**Preservation and Tourism**:
- Restoration and Access: Key sections have been restored and are accessible to tourists, with Badaling being the most visited due to its proximity to Beijing.
- Hiking Destinations: Other notable sections include Mutianyu, Simatai, and Jinshanling, each offering unique experiences ranging from intact and well-restored paths to rugged and challenging terrain for serious hikers.

**Impact**:
- Architectural Achievement: As one of the largest construction projects ever completed, it showcases ancient Chinese innovation.
- Historical Reflection: The wall encapsulates millennia of Chinese history and the dynastic changes that shaped its construction and preservation.
